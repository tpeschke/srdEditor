    <p>Jodit is a 1st level Wizard/Expert who is looking to learn a little bit more about an item she’s come across so
        she goes to Shape the Personal, Touch, Lore Mysterium spell, which is a 5-Drain spell. After 10 seconds of mild
        glowing and a little bit of concentration, she rolls a d10 and the roll explodes for a total of 14. This causes
        a Wild Surge that reshapes the spell, affecting a huge area.</p>

    <p>This works out for her though because it still catches the item she wants in the area of effect and she gets to
        renew the spell twice - thrice if she wants the extra Stress but she’s already getting 5 Stress from the Wild
        Surge (14 - 9, her threshold) and an additional 6 from just the normal fallout.
