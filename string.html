Hit Against a Standing Person knocks them back 5 ft for every Wound Category the bear has and knocks them prone - doing d4! as base but increases it by 1 dice size for every 10 ft traveled. Unless they collide with something then start with a d8!.

If a person is knocked more than 10 ft, they need to make an Athletics Check vs d20 to hold onto their items in hand.

At >20 ft, they automatically lose their grip.



Hit Against a Prone Person mauls them.

If the victim moves, the bear gets a free attack, dealing 3d3! - when Bloodied, the bear gets a reroll on its damage because of its frenzy.

Even on a miss, the victim will be rolled in a random direction in front of the bear as they're battered about; 5 ft for every Wound Category the bear has but no additional damage.

--------------------------------------------------------
If anyone does an accumulative 10+ damage to the bear, it'll drop its current prey and immediately go after them.
