|pCombat is not simply about who can do the most damage the quickest. Battles, at their heart, are manifestations of the fever of conflict going on between the two sides. This is why sometimes a small, untrained force of zealots can overcome a larger professional army.|lThis can be represented by a Confrontation happening during the combat, or a Morale Confrontation.|sMORALE CONFRONTATIONS|lAt the beginning of combat, if at least one side has a captain, a Confrontation is also started with the two opposing sides are the two opposing forces (the players vs the goblins, for example).|lThis runs like a normal Confrontation except the company captains are in charge and get to dictate pretty much everything. So as the battle progresses, the captains are going to run the Confrontation in parallel with it, trying to swing the battlefield to their advantage.|pUnlike a regular Confrontation, however, it is not about gaining points but about who wins or loses that round.|lIf you win the Confrontation round, the target behaves the way you want. This represents either them being too panicked or not having enough information to make a good decision, or effective leadership and a clear grasp of what’s going on.|sWITH A CAPTAIN|pDuring combat, a captain can, at any time, state that they want a fighter (or group of fighters) to perform an action or behave in a certain way. |pFor instance, the captain might want a fighter to switch his Tactic to be more aggressive, or swap who he’s aiming for. |lHe can also do this for enemy fighters: the only exception is they can’t make them run away (which can happen but we'll talk about that a bit later).|lSo, for example, you’re the company captain and you’re trying to convince the enemy goblin that he should try and get at your company’s ranger but currently he’s making a beeline for your fighter. In that case, you can use the fighter’s Characteristic “You Don’t Want to Mess With Me” to make an Appeal to get the goblin to second guess himself and go after your ranger.|lA captain can affect any number of fighters, however, they need to be easily “grouped”: there needs to be a good reason why every fighter “targeted” would be affected by the same Appeal.|lThe Captain can divide the Stress gain from the Appeal between him and any friendly fighter involved in the round.|bField Promotions & No Charisma |pThere might be the case a captain dies and a lieutenant is suddenly promoted, however the chain of command should have been determined beforehand.|pIn this case, decrement any Confrontation related dice by 1 size.|lIf that means the new captain has no Charisma or other skills, they’ll use their Warfare skill rounded up (so a d4! by default). So, it's better than nothing because it keeps people from just running for it and they gain less Stress but still not great.|lNote that this can also be used in cases where uncharismatic creatures have a captain (such as a goblin leading goblins).|sA SIDE WITH NO CAPTAIN|lIf one side has a captain but they're removed from combat for any reason (including going unconscious) with no replacement, everyone on their side immediately has their Panic Threshold lowered by 1 Wound Category, so keep the company captain safe!|pA side with no captain can’t actively go “on the attack”, meaning that they can no longer initiate a Confrontation round but only defend against them. |lIf they don't have any applicable personal Confrontation Die, they auto fail and gain double the Stress the enemy captain takes.|lSo, for goblins, having no warfare, no charisma, or no intelligence, they would auto-fail but if you’re facing an ettin and try to intimidate him based on strength, he would roll his strength dice (and maybe some of things because he's a big boy who can really hurt you).|lAdditionally, sides with no captains are now vulnerable to having their fighters break and run away.|bRunning Away |lNormally, running away is only caused by a fighter reaching their Stress Threshold, but, with no captain, any Panicked fighter can be convinced to turn tail and run, inflicting any Stress it would gain on the remaining fighters.|sTHE PERSONAL CONFRONTATION|pWhether or not you have a captain, individual fighters can also initiate their own, personal Confrontations with those they’re fighting.|lThese are typically 1 round affairs (or treated as such), and only involve the fighters’ Characteristics and any situational arguments that apply.|
