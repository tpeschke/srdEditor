    <div id="exportContent"><h1>Character Creation</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Welcome to Bonfire Character Creation! You'll notice that there's a lot of steps and, if you're familiar with other TTRPGs, that it's a bit longer and a bit more complicated than other games. Why is that?</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The first is that it gives you, the player, more choice. Do you want to build a cunning fighter than actually using their brains instead of their brawns to defeat others? Do you want to play a sly diplomat that crushes her opponents' morale without even lifting a finger? Or perhaps you want to play a power wizard that concocts his spells on the fly, building the perfect one for each scenario?</p><p style="margin:0px;"> More importantly, do you want those different characters to actually feel different when you play them? So that convincing some actually feels different than just beating them to death?</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is the first thing that Bonfire offers you.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The second thing is that it allows you to be surprised during creation: through your choices and rolls, you'll get a more fully formed character than in other systems. You'll get what you want with extra twists that help add interest and depth to your character that you wouldn't get in other systems.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And not only that, but you'll also have those choices, twists, and depth mean something in play. Is your character brash? You'll be rewarded for playing that way in the game.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, what are you waiting for? Let's get started!</p><h2>1. Roll Stat Scores</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character has 6 attributes that define your character physically and mentally. These are Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intellect (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha). More on details are found in <strong>Chapter 2: Stat Scores.</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"> Roll 3d6 for each of these Abilities to generate that score.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This should result in something similar to this:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Str: 13</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Dex: 7</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Con: 10</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Int: 14</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Wis: 11</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Cha: 6</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Bonfire is specifically balanced for you to roll 3d6 in order, with 10 being the average result but don't worry about feeling like you have low scores or they're not in the order you want: you'll have a chance to rearrange and modify them later.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> But even if you have objectively lower stats than the rest of the company, you'll still be able to contribute in a meaningful way in your own area of expertise because Bonfire is built as a team game, so nobody is going to be good at everything.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> In Bonfire, you'll almost always be weaker than your opponent: what makes a hero is not supernatural abilities, but the simple fact that he fights longer and harder for what he believes in than other men</p><h2>2. Receive Crp</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Alright, you have your scores. Now it’s time to determine how many Creation Points (or CrP, for short) you’ll start with. These CrP will be spent on modifying your character, buying them their skills and increasing their Scores. They may also be spent on rerolls at certain steps.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Even still, you may want to switch your stats around. This may be because you have almost the right stats, but you have a specific character concept in mind. For instance, using the example stats in Step 1, your party may need a diplomatic character more than a strong character. In this case, it would really help to swap Strength and Charisma.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You can freely switch around your stats as need but, in that case, you only receive 25 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If you switch only 4 of your stats, you receive 50 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If you switch 2, you receive 75 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And if you keep your stats the way they are, with no changes, you gain 100 CrPs to work with.</p><h2>3. Select Race</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character’s race will change how they interact with the world and what they’ll be good and bad at so pick carefully.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Details are found in <strong>Chapter 3: Races</strong> so go there and pick one and come back here when you’re done.</p><h2>4. Choose Your Archetypes</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character has an area of expertise represented by two Archetypes.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You choose a Primary and a Secondary Archetype and pay the price in CrP for both based on your race’s Archetype Cost section. Descriptions of the different Archetypes are found in <strong>Chapter 4: Archetypes</strong> along with more details on how to combine them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve chosen to reroll your stats and have no CrPs to work with, congratulations, you’re now in CrP debt and need to make it up by the end of Character Creation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You must select two Archetypes before going further.</p><h2>5. Record Archetype Abilities</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is more for Weird-Adept Archetypes, as they’ll head over to <strong>Chapter 11: The Weird</strong> to roll their starting spells but now is the time to record any free Skills, or Trainings you obtained free from your Archetype choice, as well as Archetype Abilities.</p><h2>6. Rolls Flaws</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> All heroes have flaws. That’s what makes them relatable and human (even if they’re an orc). Character Flaws earn you additional CrP, which is great. Flaws can also be used in Confrontations to further the story.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> For a list of Flaws flip to <strong>Chapter 5: Flaws.</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve gone into CrP debt and you’re not out of it by the end of this stage, you’ll need to go back and reselect your Archetypes so that you are or go back to you starting set of stats and begin Character Creation all over again with them.</p><h2>7. Adjust Stats</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Now, it is time to do the final adjustments to your stats. This isn't your final adjustments: you'll have a chance to increase them again level up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The price to increase a Stat is the Stat + 10. So, to get a Stat to 9 from 8, it would cost 18 CrP. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This can't bring a stat above 20.</p><h2>8. Calculate Character Vitals</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> Now it’s time to calculate your character’s Honor, Stress Threshold, and Vitality.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> These 3 things are important parts of the game and serve as the prime mechanics when running a Bonfire game. If you’re not familiar with them head over to <strong>Chapter 6: Character Vitals.</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This chapter will also give you an overview of the character sheet that you’ll get more acquainted with later. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve already played Bonfire before, here’s a cheat sheet for calculating those things:</p><ul><li><strong class='orangeHeader'>HONOR</strong> This is determined by your “Starting Honor” listed under your Charisma</li><li><strong class='orangeHeader'>STRESS THRESHOLD</strong> This is your three times your Wis score. </li><li><strong class='orangeHeader'>VITALITY</strong> This is Con score + Primary Archetype’s Vitality Die + Vitality Size Modifier from race, divided into 4 Categories.</li><li><strong class='orangeHeader'>MAX FAVOR</strong> While Servants are the ones that primarily use it, any person can petition the Divines for aid, although success mostly based on your Honor Category and whether or not you've been up with your Devotions. More on Favor is found in <a [routerLink]='["../../chapter/12"]' [queryParams]='{ search : "FAVORoftheDheader"}'>Chapter 12: The Divine</a>.</li></ul><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Don't forget that you get a bonus to your CrP from the Honor of your last character. If this is your first character, you instead get 25 CrP. Enjoy.</p><h2>9. Trainings & Skills</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> Trainings and Skills are additional areas of expertise that your character has obtained above his or her race and class.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Both cost CrP. Prices and descriptions can be found at the bottom of <a [routerLink]='["../../chapter/9"]' [queryParams]='{ search : "trainingsiheader"}'>Chapter 9: Combat</a> and in <strong>Chapter 7: Skills.</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Note that you get the Advanced Language Skill for free in your native language with its Rank starting at your Int.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class="sidebarTitle">Out of Order Character Creation</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> If you’re a little bit more familiar with Bonfire Character creation, these last steps (step 9, 10, and 11) can be taken in any order you’d like, even skipping back and forth between them.</p></td></tr></table><h2>10. Define Confrontation Characteristics</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your character is more than just raw stats, skills, and abilities. At this step, you’re going to define more about who they see themselves as and how others perceive them by defining their Traits, Goals, and Devotions. Jump to <strong>Chapter 8: Confrontation.</strong></p><h2>11. Buy Equipment</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> Every character starts with a kit of gear, which has a list of per purchased starting gear as well as an extra bit of starting cash they you can spend on additional things. Proceed to <strong>Chapter 10: Equipment</strong> for a full list of available kits and gear you can pick up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You may also cash in any left-over CrP for sp at 1 CrP for 10 sc, but you don’t have to. You can save your CrP to spend later at your level up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After purchasing your equipment, adjust your Carry.</p><h2>12. Transfer To Character Sheet</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Congratulations: you’re on the home stretch! Finish your character off by transferring your notes to a fresh character sheet, an example of which, with a break down, is found in <strong>Chapter 6: Character Vitals.</strong> You can also find a download for the <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L8hQ38ZjLbn9E_CDqVb6_rKG-uG_5yGX/view">character sheet here.</a></p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class="sidebarTitle">Exploding Dice</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You’ll notice an exclamation mark (!) behind a lot of dice notations. This marks the dice as exploding, which means that should the maximum of that dice is rolled, you get to roll it again, this time with a - 1, and add what you rolled to the total.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This continues for as long as you roll the maximum dice, however, the - 1 always stays a -1 one. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, if you roll a 3d8! for damage, you get a 5, 8, 8. Since you rolled the maximum value on two of your dice, you roll those dice again, and roll an 8, and 5, giving you a subtotal of 32 ( 5 + 8 + 8 + 8 - 1 + 5 - 1 ) but since you rolled another 8, you get to roll that dice again, and you get a 1, netting you a 0 ( 1 - 1 ).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are two things you should be aware of: 1d100! explode to a 1d20!, while 1d20! explode to a d6!.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The second thing is that explosion dice don’t add additional dice to the number. So, in the example above, all that damage is only counted as having been done with 3 dice (instead of the 5 that were actually rolled).</p></td></tr></table><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class="sidebarTitle">Dice Size Hierarchy</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Bonfire plays around a lot with dice sizes, so it’s important to know what dice to grab in those cases.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Dice sizes go as follows:</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d2 → d3 → d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12 → d20</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If a d4 is exploding and drops to a d3 or lower, it stops exploding.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If the dice size increases past a d20, you’ll add an extra dice starting at a d4. Further dice sizes will increase this smaller dice. This can continue ad nauseum, but no matter how many dice there are, they’re always considered to be rolled on 1 dice.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, 3d20! + d10! is still considered 1 dice.</p></td></tr></table><h1>Stat Scores</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Stat Scores represent different dimensions of your character and how good their baseline is at certain activities. These dimensions are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intellect, Wisdom, Charisma.</p><h2>Stat Checks</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> There many come a time where a Skill Check doesn’t exactly cover what needs to be tested. What skill covers trying to deadlift a boulder or remember a fact about a person? When skills fail and it’s simply a raw test of an ability, Stat Checks come into play. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Players making an unopposed ability check roll a d20 and try to get a result equal to or under their stat score. If the check is made at 1/2 the score, they're trying to roll equal to or under their score, rounded down. Should they do so, they succeed.</p><h4>OPPOSED CHECKS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Opposed checks work almost the same. The player rolls a d20! + their relevant stat score vs an opposing d20! + any relevant modifiers (such as the boulder being really heavy or only their foes relevant stat score). The person with the higher total succeeds.</p><h2>Strength</h2><table style="width:305px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="5" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Strength </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Score</td><td>Damage</td><td>Carry</td><td>Skill Mod</td><td>Confrontation</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>-4</td><td>1S</td><td>-3</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>-3</td><td>2S</td><td>-2</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td>-3</td><td>1M</td><td>-2</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td>-3</td><td>1M 1S</td><td>-1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5</td><td>-2</td><td>1M 2S</td><td>-1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6</td><td>-2</td><td>2M</td><td>-1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>7</td><td>-1</td><td>2M 1S</td><td>-1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>8</td><td>-1</td><td>2M 2S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>9</td><td>-1</td><td>1L</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>1L</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>1L</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>1L 1S</td><td>0</td><td>D4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>13</td><td>1</td><td>1L 2S</td><td>1</td><td>D4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>1L 1M</td><td>1</td><td>D6!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>15</td><td>2</td><td>1L 1M 1S</td><td>1</td><td>D6!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>1L 1M 2S</td><td>1</td><td>D8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>17</td><td>3</td><td>1L 2M</td><td>1</td><td>D8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>18</td><td>3</td><td>1L 2M 1S</td><td>2</td><td>D10!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>19</td><td>3</td><td>1L 2M 2S</td><td>2</td><td>D12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>20</td><td>4</td><td>2L</td><td>3</td><td>D20!</td></tr><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Strength (Str) represents your character’s pure brawn.

Can she dodge arrows, or can she execute a graceful pirouette? Dexterity is crucial for avoiding blows in combat or traps in a hallway.</p><h4>ATTACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Being graceful allows your character to take advantage of openings others can’t.

Can he shrug off the Dancing Death or does he succumb to a head cold? Can she take a solid blow in combat and not even blink?

If you're new to RPGs in generally, go for a race that interests you based on the flavor.</p><h4>STAT SCORE MODIFIERS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These modify the base stats that you roll. You can use it to balance out your character's weak spots or you can use it to maximize what your character is already good it. We recommend the latter as Bonfire is a game built around teamwork: you'll have friends who will be good at things your character isn't.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Note that these adjustments can't bring score above 20 or below 1.</p><h4>GAMEPLAY REWARDS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each race is meant to encourage a certain type of play. For instance, orcs gain bonuses for starting things, like combats or Confrontations, so they reward players who are aggressive, while elves get rewarded for being careful with how they engage with others. These are noted under the Racial Temperament section in their summary. </p><h4>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some races can spend less time mastering things than others, freeing up time (CrP) to focus on other pursuits or becoming true masters of their vocation. This is reflected in the Archetype Costs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You'll notice that some races will have Archetype Exceptions: these are based on the lore of that race for the Middle Realm, the official campaign setting of Bonfire. GMs should feel free to modify these prices. Actually, GMs should modify any prices to fit their setting.</p><h2>Racial Preferences</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Racial tensions exist in the Middle Realm and there’s bad blood between the different species, plus, some races get on other's nerves because of differing temperaments.

Orcs dislike elves as a whole: they're effete and cowardly and can be extremely passive-aggressive to an orc, so immediately they start off on the wrong foot, giving the elf 1 point to convince the orc. The elf, realizing that this is going to be harder than it needs to be because of the orcs bullheadedness and general lack of forethought, goes to the his human friend and tries to get him to sign on. Because humans like elves, the human would get an automatic 1 point to be convinced by the elf instead. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Orcs treat their own kin as Preferred for Racial Preferences.</p><h2>Changelings</h2><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Changeling Summary</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>MODIFIERS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> -4 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +2 Dex</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> +3 Int</p><p style="margin:0px;">Small Sized (- 1 ft to Measure, +3 to Melee & Ranged Defense, less movement, and require less food)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 10</p><h4>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Crafty</p><h4>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 0: Fighter: 15</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 5</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Weird-Adept: 5</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Changelings are strange little beings. The rumors are that their demons who've trade places with human children left out in the wild or that they're the stillborn children of wizards and witches. Either way, their wiliness and technical prowess make them welcome guests where every they end up. </p><h4>APPEARANCE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Changelings are about the size of a 10-year-old human, with extremely pale skin, unusually long fingers and large eyes. Besides this, they appear like little humans, with wispy hair on their head and face. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They dress in whatever the area custom is but tend towards bright and clashing colors. </p><h4>PERSONALITY</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Changelings are wily and crafty, and, while not lacking in morality, tend to get caught up on whatever project they're currently on. They enjoy puzzles more than anything - the thrill of having everything click into place just perfectly is the finest thing a person can experience. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also tend to be on the shy side, as much as possible, keeping out of the limelight. Worldly power and accolades hold little appeal for them, but there is a sense of wanting to be apart something greater than keeps them reaching out to the outside world. </p><h2>Dwarves</h2><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Dwarf Summary</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>MODIFIERS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> -3 Dex</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +4 Con</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> -2 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Small Sized (- 1 ft to Measure, +3 to Melee & Ranged Defense, less movement, and require less food)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 20</p><h4>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Unconquerable</p><h4>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 5: Fighter: 0</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 25<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 15</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Weird-Adept: 25</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Dwarves are called the 'Stonemen' not because they're made of stone but because they're hard as rock. They're obstinate and incorrigible and, as a rule, they never do anything that someone else wants them to do. As such, they're the most disagreeable beings in the Middle Realm. They're also the most straightforward, brave, and loyal beings as well. </p><h4>APPEARANCE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Dwarves are the opposite of elves. They're short, barrel chested with thick hair growing all over their bodies. This hair ranges from coal black to a golden hue, depending on which hold the dwarf hails from. They also always support big bushy beards that are near hard as steel. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> These beards are their pride and joy and they take great care in them. Woven into each beard is the tale of that dwarf's life and accomplishments as well as their job within the hold. You can learn a lot from reading a dwarf's beard. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Besides this and their tools, the dwarves really don't take care of themselves, eschewing anything showy or fancy, like nice fabrics or baths. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Dwarf anatomy is, thankfully, a mystery to most outsiders. All dwarves, to other races, appear human and use human pronouns, though in dwarvish, there are no pronouns because that's more bothersome. There is a rumor that there are female dwarves but that there's 0 sexual dimorphism in the species, which makes courting a very careful affair, but the running theory is that female dwarves are just anvils. </p><h4>PERSONALITY</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> As stated before, dwarves are stubborn. They're very rarely, however, psychopathically so. More often, once they have decided something, they tend to get defensive and refuse to relent unless they absolutely have to. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> This makes dwarven governments and social structures very slow moving and difficult to work with but, it also means that if you get a dwarf to agree with you, they will happily die on that hill. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> In fact, the only time that a dwarf seems to be happy is when he's being stubborn about something. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Finally, dwarves do not ascribe to social niceties. It's not that they're incapable to understanding them or aware of them: they just don't think they're worth paying attention to, in the same way that most people don't notice insects. </p><h2>Elves</h2><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Elf Summary</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>MODIFIERS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> -2 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -4 Con</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +4 Int</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> +2 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Medium Sized</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 10</p><h4>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Patient</p><h4>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 5: Fighter: 10</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 5<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 0</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Weird-Adept: 0</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Elves are the first born of the Divines. Originally, the inhabitants of the Painted World, the source of all magic, they now inhabit the Middle Realm as mentally ethereal beings.</p><h4>APPEARANCE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Elves are slender beings that are widely considered classically beautiful, though many find their features alien and off putting. They uniformly have long ears that taper to a point at the end.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Their eyes are pure white, with no iris or pupil visible, this matched with their sharp teeth, can give them a feline turn to their face.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Elves naturally survive off the ebb and flow of magic that drifts through the air of the Painted World. While still present in the Middle Realm, these winds are a sliver of their natural magnitude and so Elves need to find other sources; the main one being through the magic inherent in all living creatures. While vegetables do have magic in them, an Elf would have to consume 100s of pounds of lettuce each day to not die of starvation. The only realistic way of getting enough magic to survive is through the consumption of raw meat. </p><h4>PERSONALITY</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> To describe an Elf as “careful” would be a huge understatement. They tend to live longer than other races, not because some supernaturally long lifespan, but because they're always careful about their actions. They see other races as brash and impetuous while they're in turn seen as slow and cowardly. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> It's not they're incapable of great emotion or quick action but elves seem to understand that with every action comes a consequence, whether that action was well meaning or not, and that this karmic force is more powerful than any other law or power. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> However, once set on a course, it is hard to dissuade an elf, for they do nothing lightly.</p><h2>Gaunts</h2><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Gaunt Summary</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>MODIFIERS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> -2 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +2 Dex</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -3 Con</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -3 Int</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +2 Wis</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> +3 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Medium Sized</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 10</p><h4>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Salvation Secured</p><h4>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 0: Fighter: 0</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 25<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 0</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Weird-Adept: 0</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Gaunts are said to be depraved creatures stuck between life and death. They love filthy lucre more than what made them human. They're those that, for whatever reason, have sold part of their souls for either money or at a change at eternal life in the world to come. </p><h4>APPEARANCE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Gaunts of all races look generally the same as the soul shiving process drains them of their vitality. Their skin turns ghost white, their hair a weak grey, and their eyes become milky as if they're blind. Their bodies becoming desiccated, thin and reedy. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> They still need to eat, drink, and do other bodily functions - they are, even after all that, living. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Gaunts tend to dress in flamboyantclothing that is a mix and match of whatever they kind find. Most say this is because they loot the clothing off of those they kill but it's more likely because they just wear what they can find or because they wish to make up for their dull color palette </p><h4>PERSONALITY</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> As stated, gaunts get a bad rep for being whollywithout morals but that's not always the case. Some have undergone the process because they need to feed their families or out of a powerful sense of devotion or religious zeal so actually gaunts run the spectrum of personality types: they're just saddled with their reputation because of an admittedly not small section of them. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> What makes up the gaunt's personality is why he made the sacrifice to do what he did. Why was so precious to him that he would make such a huge sacrifice for? That's a complicated question and not easy to answer by the gaunt player should have their answer before play begins. </p><h2>Humans</h2><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Human Summary</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>MODIFIERS</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Medium Sized</p><p style="margin:0px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 15</p><p style="margin:0px;">Increase your Honor Dice by 1 size</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Your Strong and Medium Traits start out with 1 extra dice</p><h4>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">We all have our theories on what personality traits that are shared by the human race, and I'm not interested in wading in on that debate so instead of having a Racial Temperament, they get special modifiers. </p><h4>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 0: Fighter: 0</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 0<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 0</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Weird-Adept: 0</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Humans are the first natives of the Middle Realm.

Through the Bonfire they've formed a New Covenant with the Divines, remaking their minds in their image. They were the founders of the First Empire and their legacy is still cleaved to by the kings of the age. </p><h4>APPEARANCE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Minotaurs are huge creatures that are half man and half bull. Specifically, the head and upper torse, as well as the legs are bull, while the chest, shoulders, and arms are those of a man. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Both male and female are larger than the average person, with males standing on average about 7 ft tall and the woman standing at around 6 ft tall. Males sprout horns, though they lack the strength to effectively gore with them like their bull counterparts. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Their skin color, as well as their fur color and pattern, vary by region, with traditional tanner skinned minotaurs coming from the south and light skinned ones coming from the north but during the days of the First Empire there was so much population movement that this is a trend rather than a rule. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Note that Minotaurs are more closely related to Beastfolk than they are to cows and so are, in fact, carnivorous. </p><h4>PERSONALITY</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Minotaurs cut royal figures and their personalities match. They have an extreme sense of pride and a great depth of feeling in accordance with their bestial nature. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They're extremely devoted to whatever cause they throw their weight behind and there is no difference to them between their opinions and themselves, making them very cocksure. This can, unsurprisingly, make them bullies as they care little for other's opinions about things. </p><h2>Orcs</h2><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Orc Summary</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>MODIFIERS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> +4 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +3 Con</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -4 Int</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> -4 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Medium Sized</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 15</p><h4>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Aggressive</p><h4>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 10: Fighter: 0</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 15<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 20</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Weird-Adept: 10</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Heirs to a great empire long since lost to the ages, the orcs cling to tradition in the wake of uncertain and dark times. Some say that they value only strength but to truly known an orc is to know the soul of honor.</p><h4>APPEARANCE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Orcs have dark green or grey skin with porcine nose and tusks that jut up from their lower jaw. They tend to be stocky, with thick muscles and hunched shoulders.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Their hair is wiry, closer to steel wool than anything else and their eyes are completely black, with no pupils or irises, giving them an indescribable inhumanness to it.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Naturally, orcs are scavengers, able to survive on practically anything, no matter how rotten or foul.</p><h4>PERSONALITY</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> An orc’s life is defined by struggle: from birth to death, they conceptualize the universe as having a vendetta against them. This can often give them a martyr complex and make them morose traveling companions at times because they feel the weight of the world. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> They can also come across as aggressive, which some have pointed out is a defense mechanism, but orcs would simply scoff at that.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There’s nothing an orc values more than their honor and the chance to prove themselves against a worthy foe. This is often seen in their deities across orcish cultures, which are almost exclusively pantheons of their greatest foes. It is taken for granted that you are only as good as your enemies. </p><h2>Ratfolk</h2><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Ratfolk Summary</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>MODIFIERS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> -6 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -4 Con</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +3 Wis</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> +5 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Small Sized (- 1 ft to Measure, +3 to Melee & Ranged Defense, less movement, and require less food)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 10</p><h4>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Helpful</p><h4>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 0: Fighter: 15</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 5</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Weird-Adept: 5</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Ratfolk are social creatures. They love people and being around people. Others find them pleasant to be around. As such, Ratfolk can be found as diplomats, traders, and minstrels . </p><h4>APPEARANCE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Ratfolk are smaller and slimmer than other races, with lithe, fur covered bodies that range from auburn to dark black. They have beady eyes and long tails. For the most part, they appear like their smaller cousins, though with lighter frames and opposable thumbs. </p><h4>PERSONALITY</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> As stated, ratfolk are people people. They're extremely social and, as a rule, are extroverted. They tend to be agreeable and try to get along with everyone but this shouldn't be taken as people pleasing or weak because ratfolk are clever - dangerously so. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> People tend to think that because ratfolk are so easy going that they're push overs and that they can be taken advantage of but ratfolk sees it as "I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine" kind of deal so they're not just going to do things to do things. They very much believe in the social contract, but their animal nature makes them ruthless as some points. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> In fact, ratfolk can be quite ruthless to those they deem outside their pack, which has earned them some reputation as having a herd mentality. For ratfolk the only war is total war. </p><h1>Archetypes</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Archetypes represent your character’s background training and starting skills and there are two types of Archetypes: Generalist and Specialist.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GENERALIST ARCHETYPES </strong>represent the overall theme. For instance, Fighter Archetypes tend to be good at things related to combat. So, if you’re looking to make a combat focused character, you can look there. They are Expert, Weird-Adept, Servant, Socialite, and Fighter. You must pick two starting out.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Generalists will have a wide variety of discounts within their theme that are good for just getting straight bonuses.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SPECIALIST ARCHETYPES </strong>represent a more focused version of the Generalist Archetypes. They’re more expensive but come with additional powers. When you purchase a Specialist Archetype, it replaces the Generalist Archetype of the same time. So, for instance, if you’re in Expert, you can replace it with the Ranger or the Thief. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Once you purchase a Specialist Archetype, you are stuck with it.</p><h4>PURCHASING ARCHETYPES</h4><p style="margin:0px;">First choose a Generalist Primary and a Generalist Secondary Archetype and pay the price in CrP for both based on your race.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You use the Vitality Die, the Skills & Trainings, and the Primary Drawback sections from the Primary, and combine both Archetype Abilities sections, though you remove 1 leveling ability from your Secondary Archetype, unless you Double Specialize.</p><p style="margin:0px;">All Generalists, except for the Servant, can be selected as both your Primary and Secondary Archetype, called Double Specializing. So, you can be a Fighter/Fighter but not a Servant/Servant.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The benefits for double specializing will be noted at the end of the Archetype.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If two characters have the same ability, unless it says otherwise, those abilities stack.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PURCHASING SPECIALIST ARCHETYPES</strong> At 1st level and at every level up, you can purchase a Specialist Archetype. If at 1st level, see the Specialist Archetypes at 1st Level sidebar below.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You’ll pay an additional 20 CrP for each one you’re replacing regardless.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Unlike Generalists, Weird-Adept Specialist Archetypes that you can double specialize in. So, you can be a Runegalder/Runegalder but not a Cateran/Cateran.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you choose to double specialize in a Generalist Archetype and then later switch out one of your Archetypes for a Specialist, you retain that double specialist bonus until you swap out the second, but, at that point, if you specialize your secondary Archetype, you'll have to then forfeit an ability.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Your GM may choose to reject an Archetype combination based on the fact that the two Archetypes don’t fit together thematically. So, while a Thief/Priest (Beast Covenant) might be really powerful because of the Beast Covenant’s Shape Changing ability, if there’s not a Patron of Thieves and Animals in the campaign world, you’re out of luck.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Specialist Archetypes completely replaces everything from the Generalist Archetype they’re replacing though it doesn’t retroactively remove things you’ve already rolled for or free purchases.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, a Fighter, with a d10 Vitality Die decides, at level 4 to become a Soldier with a Vitality Die of a d8. He doesn’t then reroll all his Vitality Die - from that point forward, he simply uses the d8 instead.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Remember that if you’re replacing your Secondary Archetype, you’ll still need to select a leveling ability from your new Archetype to remove.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Specialist Archetypes At 1st Level</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you’re more familiar with the game, your playstyle, and which Archetypes suit you, you might consider purchasing your Specialization(s) at 1st level. That’s perfectly fine, but you’ll still need to pay the CrP for both the Generalist and the Specialist.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You’re considered to have purchased your Generalist Archetype first AND THEN purchased your Specialist, which means that you still get any free stuff from abilities that say "at first level" from your Generalist, so Experts get some free skills and Weird-Adepts get their starting Rudiments.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Your Primary Specialist’s Vitality Die and Primary Drawback also replaces your Primary Generalist’s.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you’ve already bought a Basic Training that a Specialist comes with, you receive its worth in CrP as a bonus. This doesn’t extend to Skills since their benefits stack.</p></td></tr></table><h2>Expert</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to use your wits to defeat your opponent or avoid combat altogether.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Experts are those that focus on real-world non-combat skills, as opposed to relying on the Divines, magic, or their sword arm as a source of strength. They tend to rely on Intellect and Wisdom, primarily, though there are Experts that focus on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution for more physical skills.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d8</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITES</strong> Two Different Ones of your Choice</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL ADEPT </strong>This character has a knack for skills.

Fighters focus on combat and battle, either by training and discipline or by out maneuvering their opponent. Unsurprisingly, this Archetype focuses on Constitution, but how you approach combat may decide whether you favor Strength, Dexterity, or even Intellect or Wisdom.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d10</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Athletics or Tactics</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Fighters gain Weapon Basic Training in 2 weapons and Light Armor Basic Training.</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">IMPROVED ADVANCED TRAINING </strong>A Fighter is a master of weaponry and armor, spending years conditioning himself to be able to use the weapons of war in battle without breaking a sweat.

Servants play the best with others, often modifying the other Archetype’s powers with Divine assistance.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d6</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITES</strong> Trades and Lore</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Servants get 3 free purchases of the Religion Advanced Skill for free.</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CALLED & CHOSEN </strong>A Servant seeks to do the will of those who sent them, furthering their agendas in the Middle Realm and so they are blessed. They add their level to their Max Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DEPTHS of DEVOTION </strong>A Servant understand the bonds of giving your life to a cause greater than your own and its strengths. They gain a free Devotion to their Divine, starting at 3. They also start Anointed in their cult.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FORMER LIFE </strong>A Servant can be called from anywhere and any walk of life. Select any Archetype ability. This can be either from the Generalist you chose as a Secondary or a Specialist within the category to which your Secondary belongs. Former Life has all the same effects as that ability, though it still counts as a separate leveling ability.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This ability stays with you after you replace the Servant Generalist Archetype, however, if it is a leveling ability, it stops leveling, even if your pick the Specialist Archetype it's from. </p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">None</p><h2>Socialite</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to talk your way out of problems and inspire others to give you your way.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Socialites are people people. They seem to get a real kick out of interacting with others, especially if it ends with them getting their way. While others' first weapons are swords, a Socialite's first weapon is their charm. Unsurprisingly, Socialites tend to rely on Intellect and Charisma.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d4</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Streetwise</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STRONG PERSONALITY </strong>As a Socialite grows, she becomes more confident in who she is and what she wants.

Weird-Adepts rely more on clever applications of spells rather than outright doing damage and so can often subtly shift the playing field in their favor. They rely mainly on Intellect and Wisdom since they need a high Stress Threshold as it is extremely stressful to shape Weird.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d4</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Weirdcraft</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RUDIMENTARY KNOWLEDGE </strong>Weird-Adepts know the basics of shaping the Weird and so start out with 5 random Rudiments.

They can also help others, giving them a chance to try again at Skill Checks they fail.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d8</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITES</strong> Two Different, non-Lore Skill Suites</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HELPING HAND</strong> The Adventurer is not just about knowing things but also giving others a helping hand in times of need. When another person uses an Adventurer’s help, either as an Asset, or one of his Helper Skills or Preparation, they receive an additional +1 to their roll. This bonus increases by +1 for every 2 levels the Adventurer has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MIDDLE NAME: DANGER</strong> For the Adventurer, danger is calming and straightforward and that’s what they crave. Whenever an Adventurer takes damage, they can heal that amount of Stress.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">OUTTHINKING</strong> While they may not be the best with the blade, the Adventurer is often able to beat their opponents by outthinking them. Gain a use of your Honor dice whenever you use a Skill in combat, regardless of whether or not its successful. Gain an additional one for every 3 levels you've obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Any < 7 CrP, 7)</strong> At first level and every level up, Adventurers receive 7 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skills under 7 CrP in base cost (before Skill Adept). These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL ADEPT</strong> This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Adventurers tend to eschew book smarts for street smarts: the Lore Skill Suite and any Lore Advanced Skills cost double.</p><h2>Assassin</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to dispatch unaware opponents quickly, either by stabbing your target in the back, by poisoning them, or by slitting their throats.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Assassin is a master killer, gaining a chance to increase their damage against unaware opponents and being able silence helpless ones quickly. They're also masters of poison use, knowing how to most effectively apply their killer medicine.</p><h4>VITALITY</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Streetwise</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BACKSTAB</strong> When using any small melee weapon against an unaware target (one that is either not aware of your presence or one that is unaware that you, personally, mean harm to them), the Assassin’s weappon's base damage explodes on the highest and second highest result. i.e., d4!s explode on natural 3s and 4s. They also gain an additional dice of damage at 1st level and every 2 levels after that when backstabbing, which doesn’t increase the total number of dice for /D armor but isn't effected by anything that would otherwise increase the weapon's damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If an opponent flees and the Assassin is within half their weapon Recovery, they may Backstab using half their additional damage dice from this ability, rounded up. This, however, he can do with any weapon (althougth he'll need to snapshot his attack if using a ranged weapon unless he attacks the same second they flee).</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SILENT TAKEDOWN</strong> If an Assassin attacks an unaware opponent with any weapon and beat his victim's defense by more than 10, the attack has the opportunity to be silent. If the victim fails their Trauma check, they simply keel over quietly its duration, after which, they can get up and start yelling (should the Assassin have left them alive).</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If, however, the Assassin beats their defense by 10 but their victim succeeds at their Trauma check, the Assassin has still managed to silence them for 3d6! seconds, however their victim isn't helpless and attack otherwise act normally. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">IMPROVED COUP de GRACE</strong> An Assassin has studied the weak parts of their target’s anatomy and can quickly make a killer strike. Coup de Graces only take 5 seconds. This is always done completely silent. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">COOL HEADED </strong>Where others would get blustered, the Assassin stays cool, even when he’s stressing. When making a Skill Check, lower the base amount of Stress you get by 2.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILLED POISONER</strong> An Assassin has intimate knowledge of poisons and how to use them. When someone is poisoned by the Assassin, increase that poison's Lethality by 1 for every level that Assassion has obtained. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If the first roll against the poison is greater than 10, the poison has been so artfully placed that it also silences the victim, only a success allows them to cry out.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Being a trained killer is not an honorable profession and people don’t like murders around. If your profession becomes publicly known, you lose 5 Honor. </p><h2>Mastermind</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to beat Skill Challenges more through use of Strategies rather than raw Ranks in a Skill.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Mastermind is a plotter: preparing themselves and laying out plans before they step foot into the Skill Challenge. They get bonuses for utilizing all the options presented in the Strategies section, meaning that, by the time they step into the ring, they’re unbeatable in their element.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d6 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> One of your Choice</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FRIENDS in ALL PLACE </strong>A Mastermind has contacts and knows how to use them. When using an Asset, the Mastermind gains a +1 at first level and increases it by 1 for every level they’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MANAGE MINIONS </strong>Any Mastermind worth his salt will keep a stable of minions around to help him out, even if they're the other players. When he uses one of their Skills, or vice versa, as a Helper Skill, the Stress gain is halved.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PREP PAYS OFF </strong>People take pride in having their plans work out, the Mastermind doubly so. Whenever a reroll from Preparation results in a success when the original roll would have caused a failure, the Mastermind receives 1 free use of their Honor Die for the rest of the Skill Challenge.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">The RIGHT TOOL for the RIGHT TIME </strong>If you’re careful with how you treat your equipment and come prepared, you can see yourself through a tough spot. Once per Skill Challenge and an additional time for every 2 levels they’ve obtained, ignore the degradation of a piece of equipment you use on a Check.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Any, 3)</strong> At first level and every level other up, Masterminds receive 3 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skill. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL ADEPT </strong>This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Failure means that the Mastermind didn’t plan as well as he should have. He gains an additional 2d6! Stress at the end of any Skill Challenge for each Obstacle that he fails, even if he got what he wanted out of the Challenge. </p><h2>Opportunist</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a lucky character who can alter the unexpected to be in his favor.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There’s just something about these types of people that seem to warp probability in their favor. And those lucky few who use this to their advantage to go far.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">the higher of 2d6 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> According to your Secondary Archetype</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Opportunists gain any free Skills & Trainings from their Secondary Archetype.</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LUCKY </strong> The Opportunist is naturally blessed with the ability to get out of trouble and use that adrenaline that comes as death comes near to dodge the grim reaper and keep running. After the results are given, the Opportunist can take 2 Stress to modify his results by 1. These may be done with the following conditions:</p><ul><li>They can never be used to make you a better fighter. Stress gained this way can only be used to dodge death or escape a bad situation but never to make your character a superman. </li><li>The character must think of a situation that saves his rear end, something that happens to him that’s to his advantage. </li></ul><p style="margin:0px;">The key here is that it can’t be impossible but it can be highly improbable. The chandelier rope breaking right at that moment separating him from a blood thirsty guard, a pigeon flying across an archer’s view intercepting an arrow, etc. are all acceptable.</p><p style="margin:0px;">It can’t be the result of skill. Him deflecting the blade with his hand like a badass is right out.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Should the character be unable to think of a scenario that fits both of these criteria, he’s unable to gain Stress to save himself.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FALL FORWARD </strong>Some people seem to stubble into where they need to be, even when they completely fail. When the Opportunist fails a Check, takes damage, or loses a round, he gains a roll of his Honor Dice. This is limited to 1 initially (so failing a second roll won't do him any good at level 1), but for every 3 levels the Opportunist has obtained, he increases the max number of Honor Dice this ability gives him by 1.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">NATURAL ADVANTAGE </strong>An Opportunist lives on his wits and his ability to use every advantage. At the start of every Combat, Confrontation, or Skill Challenge, he may change one thing about the field for every 5 Stress he takes. These changes must be consistent with an overarching setting (he can’t choose to have the inn change to a ship or flood right at that moment but he can choose to have a convenient chair or barrel right behind one of his enemies or reposition himself next to the fighter).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Stress is lowered by 1 for every other level he’s obtained, down to 3, though he may use this ability multiple times, but it doubles the Stress penalty each time he does so. This resets the next time he has the opportunity to heal Stress.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Luck is a top-heavy thing: Opportunists don’t get their Vitality reroll every other level, however, they do get bumped up to their Min. Vitality from their Constitution if they’re below it. </p><h2>Professional</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a character that gets stronger as they fail to overcome Obstacles.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While other Experts focus on knowledge, the Professional focuses on when to apply that knowledge and how to use their time effectively. The work with the Clocks of the Skill Challenge primarily, rather than being just good at Skill Checks. </p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d6 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> One of your Choice</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">UNDER PRESSURE </strong>When times get tough, the tough get going and the Professional is tough. When you or an ally hard fails an Obstacle, you gain an additional use of your Honor Die for the remainder of the Challenge. This increases by 1 Honor Die for every level you’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BUYING TIME </strong>The sands of the hourglass trickle onward but sometimes you can slow it down for a moment or two. During a Skill Challenge on a failed Check, for each point of Honor you spend to modify the roll, increase your roll by 2 instead. This can’t, however, turn the failure into a success so if you intend to change failure into success, you don't gain this benefit.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">WATCHING EACH OTHER’S BACK </strong>Whenever one does their job, everyone can rest easy. If two or more allies are Multitasking, they both get a +1 to one of their rolls for every 2 levels the Professional has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Any, 3)</strong> At first level and every level other up, Professional receive 3 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skill. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL ADEPT </strong>This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Professional is a man of reputation and so, when it is besmirched, it affects him gravely. For every 5 Honor you lose, lose an additional 1.</p><h2>Ranger</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to have a good range of survival skills, use your team to overcome Obstacles, but also move quicker on and off the battlefield. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Ranger’s strengths rely mostly in their survival skills, making them excellent to have in the wilderness but they also gain a bonus to their movement that allows them to out-pace others during skirmishes. </p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d8</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Survival</p><h4>ARCHETYPES ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">QUICK FOOTED</strong> The Ranger relies on being able to cross great swaths of land quickly, chasing down their prey. At first level and for every 2 levels he’s obtained, the Ranger increases his base movement rate categories by 1 foot. He can't increase it again until all other movement categories have been increased in a like manner.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A first level Ranger can choose Stroll/Crawling, Walking, Jogging, Running, Sprinting. If he chooses Walking, his Walk becomes 6 ft / second. At level 3, he can choose Strolling/Crawling, Jogging, Running, or Sprinting, but not Walking. After he's increased all by 1 ft, he can go back and increase his Walk again.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PUT YOUR HEADS TOGETHER</strong> For survival, communication is key and doing so quickly is often extremely important. When using each other as Assets, all allies of the Ranger have their Organization considered 1 better.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HIKING CONDITIONING </strong>A Ranger is used to running and jumping for hours on end with equipment on their back so gain a +1S to their Carry for every 2 levels obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Survival, 5)</strong> At first level and every level up, Rangers receive 5 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skills from the Survival Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL ADEPT</strong> This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Ranger finds armor restricting and irritating: all Armor Advanced Trainings are 2 CrP more expensive per Tier (Tier 1: 11 CrP, Tier 2: 16 CrP, Tier 3: 22 CrP).</p><h2>Sage</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play an extremely knowledge person as well as use that knowledge to give bonuses to your company.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Sage gets some of the most expensive and cerebral skills for free but also, because of his intense training, he has the ability to instantly reroll any skill he chooses.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITES</strong> Lore Twice</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MEMORY TRAINING</strong> The Sage’s training doesn’t just revolve around studying but also on how to study, allowing them better recall of information than those without such mental discipline. The Sage may reroll 1 Int, Wis, or Cha based Skill Check for 7 Stress. They may do this multiple times but each time they do so between opportunities where they can heal Stress costs them double, however, they also lower this Stress gain by 1 for every 3 levels they’ve obtained, down to 3.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FRANK DISCUSSION </strong>You can often get more out of a discussion than you can simply thinking about something. When used as an Asset, the person receives a +1 to their Skill Check and an additional +1 for every 3 levels the Sage has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Lore, 5)</strong> At first level and every level up, Sages receive 5 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skill from the Lore Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL ADEPT</strong> This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Sage has spent most of his time buried in study and so may take a bit longer to react to reality: they always roll an initiative die 1 size larger. </p><h2>Thief</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play an expert in stealth and intelligence gathering.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Thief has the widest variety of skills, picking from a uniquely built suite, rather than a predetermined one on top of their other free skills.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Streetwise</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thieves receive 3 free purchases of Language (Thieves Cant).</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">THIEF’S TRAINING</strong> At first level and every 2 levels they obtain, the Thief receives 4 free purchases in Advanced Skill from the list found below. This can be doubled up into a single skill or spread between any number of them. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Thief's Training Skills</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A thief may choose from the following skills:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>- Any One Selected At First Level: - Hiding</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>- Appraisal (Specific): - Law (Culture)</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>- Climbing: - Move Silently</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>- Distraction: - Scavenging</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>- Escape Artist</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BROTHER/SISTERHOOD</strong> When you know others have your back and you have theirs, it’s much easier to keep your calm. Everyone within sight (or other form of communication) of the thief increases their Stress Threshold by 5. This bonus increases by 1 for every 2 levels the Thief has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Streetwise, 3)</strong> At first level and every level up, Thieves receive 3 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skill from the Streetwise Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL ADEPT</strong> This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thieving is not an Honorable profession. A Thief loses 5 Honor should their profession become publicly known. </p><h2>Wilderman</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a pioneer or trapper, raised by wild animals but with a kinship to the same.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Wilderman is a savage by most standards. They tend to be those raised in the wild by feral creatures, or those mountain men that retreated to the frontier so long ago that they’ve lost the rounded edges that civilization originally bestowed on them. </p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d12 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Survival Twice</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ANIMAL AFFINITY </strong>The Wilderman has a natural connection to the beasts. As such, he can form bonds with them quicker than humans. A Wilderman can use one of his followers at any time to attract an environmentally appropriate animal companion instead.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You may never gain more than 1 animal companion at one time.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONING </strong>Being outside in all seasons and weather, hardens the Wilderman. He considers himself up to 40 degrees warmer or colder than the surrounding climate.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ONE PACK </strong>The Wilderman knows that you either survive together or die separately. Anyone can use anyone else’s Honor Dice; however they take Stress equal to what they roll on it.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ANIMAL FRIEND </strong>Being around animals allows you to really get in their head and communicate with them on a level that civilized people just can't. This ability allows the Wilderman to get into a Confrontation with any Natural Animals to move their disposition from Hostile to Neutral or from Neutral to Friendly, though not from Hostile to Neutral in one Confrontation. This is only temporary, however, ending a few hours after first contact.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SAVAGE MAN in a SAVAGE LAND </strong>A Wilderman is used to fighting in all conditions, good or bad. They gain a +1 to their Checks when they're suffering from penalties from terrain or weather. This increases by 1 for every 2 levels they've obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Survival Skill Suite) </strong>At first level and every level up, Wildermen receive a free purchase in the Survival Skill Suite.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A Wilderman finds no comfort in society and they often find themselves ill-at-ease in the company of others: all races are considered 2 steps down the Racial Preference table.</p><h2>Barbarian</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a cunning fighter that uses combat Tactics to best your opponent, rather than raw skill.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">“Barbarian” is often a derogatory term used by people who consider themselves civilized but the truth is that the Barbarian is a title of honor. The Barbarian is a survivor and survives on wit, rather than raw power. </p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d10 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Survival</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Barbarians also gain Armor Basic Training (Light) and 3 Weapon Basic Trainings, 1 for a 2 handed weapon, a ranged weapon, and small weapon</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ADVANCED TACTICS </strong>A Barbarian is a skirmisher and doesn’t rely on formalized training methods like other fighters. As such, their greatest strength is the utilization of Tactics. At 1st level and at every 2nd level after that, a Barbarian can increase the bonus or lower the penalty for a Tactic by 1, though they can never make a penalty a bonus nor go beyond double a bonus’s original amount. So, the max you can get the Faint to is +10 to Attack and +0 to your Defense.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This doesn't remove requirements (such as moving) or special penalties (such as dealing half damaged while Feinting against people who Step Back or Retreat). </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRIBAL WEAPONRY </strong>Trained from birth with tribal weapons, the Barbarian thinks of disparate weapons all as extensions of his arm. At 1st level, the Barbarian picks a 2 handed weapon, a ranged weapon, and a small weapon. All these weapons are considered 1 group: any Advanced Training purchased for one of them is applied to every other weapon. They’re considered Tier 2 for price.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CONSTANT VIGILANCE </strong>Pay attention or end up as monster chow. Everyone receives a -1 to their Initiative for every 5 levels the Barbarian has obtained </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HIKING CONDITIONING </strong>A Barbarian is used to running and jumping for hours on end with equipment on their back so gain a +1S to their Carry for every 2 levels obtained.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Barbarians haven’t benefited fully from the learning of more advanced civilizations. All Skills with Int as a relevant ability cost 2 CrP more.</p><h2>Berserker </h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a warrior that charges into battle and gets stronger the more wounded they become.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Berserker is a child of war, often raised from an early age in the most punishing conditions to harden them. In battle they fly into a primal rage, craving through enemies like warm butter. </p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">higher of 2d12</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> None</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Berserkers receive 1 Weapon Basic Training.</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PAIN TOLERANT </strong>The Berserker has learned to simply overpower his pain sensors and keep fighting. At 1st level, he gains a + 3 bonus to his Trauma check. This increased by 1 for every 2 levels he's obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">AGGRESSIVE FIGHTER </strong>The Berserker never backs down. In a Morale Confrontation, they can never be forced to take a defensive action. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SCARIFICATION </strong>For every battle and victim, the Berserker scars himself to commemorate his victory. Over time, these scars serve as armor as his skin hardens. The Berserker gains 1 DR at first level and for every 4 levels obtained. Against a weapon, use whichever is highest (whether it’s the /D or static DR). This ability does stack with armor but the scars chaff and rub, so double any penalties gained from wearing it.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This scarification is unsettling to look upon. The Berserker also gains a 2d8 Trait “Intimidating Presence” because of them. This is separate from the Trait “Battle Scars”.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BATTLE FRENZY </strong>These warriors are able to drive themselves into a crazed frenzy, giving them almost supernatural abilities. While in a Battle Frenzy, the Berserker doubles his bonuses from Pain Tolerant and Scarification and makes them temporarily immune to penalties from Stress, though they still gain Stress from Wounds as per normal.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The DR granted from Scarification also applies to the damage dealt by Running and Sprinting, however, it is effectively halved for Sprinting.</p><p style="margin:0px;">On top of this, whenever they kill an opponent, they heal an amount of damage equal to the amount under 0 he puts them. So, a Berserker deals 10 damage to a person with 6 Vitality left, bringing the enemy to -4 and healing the Berserker 4 Vitality. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Battle Frenzy increases as the warrior nears death. When a Berserker is Hurt they gain an additional dice of damage equal to their Honor Die and when Wounded they gain another. This doesn't increase the effective dice number.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There are drawbacks to the Frenzy. The first is that the Berserker can take no defensive actions. This includes any defensive Tactics but also prevents him from actively crouching behind his shield for cover and, when doing aggressive actions, they are less careful, doubling their penalties from the same. Additionally, there is a price to pay for driving your body for so long; when you drop out of the Frenzy, you take enough damage, on one Wound, to drop you another Wound Category. You also gain no benefits from Taking a Breather after doing so until you drop another Wound Category (so you can't just heal it back up, sorry). </p><p style="margin:0px;">This Frenzy is awoken by the Berserker and takes 3d6 seconds to get into, during which time the Berserker beats his chest, screams at the sky, and just generally psyches himself up. The more wounded the Berserker becomes, however, the easier it is to get into the right frame of mind, so remove a d6 for every Wound Category he has dropped. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SHARED FRENZY </strong>Some of the manic power the Berserker commands overflows and invigorates his allies. Those on the Berserker’s side can Run for an additional 3 seconds per Berserker level and can Sprint an additional 1 second per Berserker level without taking damage or increasing that Running and Sprinting damage dice.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Berserkers are killers and can sometimes get lost in the glory of battle. After downing every foe on the battlefield, they need to make a Wisdom check. On a failure, they’re unable to calm down and attack the nearest person, friendly or not. After every attack they make, they can make another Wis check to try and snap out of it. Failure indicates they keep attacking.</p><h2>Brawler</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a streetbrawler that can grab, disarm, shift, and trip your opponent to your heart's pleasure.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">On the streets or in the arena, you’ll find the Brawler, battling it out. For the joy of throwing their opponents around like a rag doll, they fight. Brawlers are unarmed fighters primarily, eager to toss anyone that opposes them aside.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d12 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Streetwise</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">REGISTERED WEAPONS </strong>The Brawler knows how to appear like a threat, even when unarmed. They always count as having a weapon for Weapon Style.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">IMPROVED ADVANCED TRAINING </strong>Brawlers train to be deadly artists with their fists and soon gain a knack for it. For Brawlers, Unarmed Advanced Trainings have a Base Cost of 5.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MARTIAL TRAINING </strong>A Brawler receives a free Weapon Advanced Training for Unarmed Combat for every level he’s obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">OPPORTUNISTIC FIGHTER </strong>Part of being a streetfighter is seizing every chance you get to get ahead. A Brawler and his allies score a Near Perfect Attack and Defense on a roll of 18 and 19.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">IMMOVABLE </strong>By planting yourself and watching your structure, you can really push people around. You gain an effective + 1 to your Vitality Size Modifier for Knock-Backs. On top of this, you lower your enemy's Vitality Size Modifier by 1 for Knock-Backs as well. This bonus increased by 1 every level.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Something about being a Brawler makes them shun weapons where they can’t get up and personal with their opponent. Ranged Weapon Advanced Trainings cost 2 CrP more.</p><h2>Cateran</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a fighter that flanks their opponent, keeping them from moving or engaging others in combat.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Cateran is all about flanking your opponent and keeping other fighters locked down. As such, they work best with other fighters.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d8</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Tactics Twice</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Caterans receives 1 Weapon Basic Training.</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BABY-SITTING</strong> While an individual Cateran may vary in his ability to take care of infants, they all share the ability to keep combatants locked down.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Whenever a person engaged with the Cateran tries to disengage, the Cateran gets an immediate free attack that, if it hits, deals half damage. This happens regardless of where they are on the Clock and doesn’t affect when their next attack happens. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CLOSED OPENINGS</strong> Flanking is the art of dividing people’s attention and the Cateran has perfected that art. Anyone flanked by a Cateran lowers their attack die by 1 size, regardless of who they’re attacking.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MUTIEREN</strong> A Cateran knows to move their blade to get into places their opponents wouldn't expect. If facing an enemy whose weapon has a base Parry or who is carrying a shield, the Cateran receives a +1 to Attack +1 for every 2 levels they've obtained. This ability isn't effective against people who gained their Parry solely through training.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SHADOWING</strong> By keeping close to their opponent, the Cateran can negate people’s defensive posturing. By taking 7 Stress, a Cateran can negate any bonuses an opponent gets from moving, whether that’s shifting, stepping back, or whatever and also stops their opponent from moving. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> The Cateran can do this as many times as they want but the Stress cost doubles each time they do so, though this resets once they’ve had time to destress. Also, this Stress cost is lowered by 1 for every 3 levels they’ve obtained, down to 3 Stress.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BUM RUSH</strong> A Cateran can also use his allies to more effectively flank their opponents. When flanking from the side, you and your allies lower your target’s defense die by 1, including the dice of those using shields (though they still get a chance to Parry). This doesn’t, however, give you any benefit for attacking from directly behind.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Cateran is a group fighter and fighting alone can be unnerving for him. When engaged with enemies alone and not flanking, the Cateran is unable to use his Honor.</p><h2>Man-at-arms</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play someone who uses their Advanced Trainings to gain even greater bonuses agains their opponents.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Man-at-Arms uses his own know-how against his opponents. She gets more deadly the more Advanced Trainings she gains. With this she can adapt to who she is fighting where others can’t.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d10</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Athletics</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Man-at-Arm receives 3 free Weapon Basic Training Trainings.</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">KNOW YOUR ENEMY</strong> A Man-at-Arms is good at watching her foe and exploiting weaknesses. For every 20 seconds she is either Threatening someone or someone is Threatening her, she gains a cumulative bonus to Attack, Defense, Recovery, or Damage. This bonus, and what she can choose to apply it to is based on her Advanced Trainings in the weapon, armor, or shield the opponent is using.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Tier 3 gives her a +1, Tier 2 gives her a +2, and Tier 1 gives her a +3. She can only apply this bonus to a metric she has an Advanced Training Bonus in. So, for example, if she is fighting someone with a slashing sword and she has a +1 to Attack and Defense with all Slashing weapons (Tier 2), that means, for every 20 seconds she is fighting that person, she can add an additional +2 to her Attack or Defense. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> This bonus is applied to one metric per person and everything resets should that foe become completely unengaged with her. So, if the Man-At-Arms is Threatening two foes for 20 seconds, she can apply her bonus to attacking one, while the other bonus goes to defending against another. If one she is defending against leaves, she has to continue applying her bonus to attacking the other. Should that foe threaten her again, she gains no bonuses again him but can change to attacking him as well. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> The time it takes to accrue this bonus is lowered 1 second for level the Men-at-Arms obtains, down to a minimum 1 second. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">COUNTING COUP</strong> Part of being a Man-at-Arms is keeping a reputation for your skill in combat and this can often become a game that everyone gets caught up in. If you give yourself a penalty to Attack, you gain 1 Honor and gain Relaxation equal to that penalty if you score a hit. If you've already used this ability once this Combat, your allies may do so as well, gaining an additional point of Relaxation (but not Honor) for each teammate who's successfully couted coup before them.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MARTIAL TRAINING </strong>A Man-at-Arms receives his choice of a free Tier 2 or 3 Armor, Shield, or Weapon Advanced Training for every levels he's obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">IMPROVED ADVANCED TRAINING</strong> A Man-at-Arms studies the greatest weapon, armor, and shield techniques to pick them up easier. For them, Tier 1 Weapon, Shield, Armor Advanced Training has a Base Cost of 7, Tier 2 has a Base Cost of 8, and Tier 3 a Base Cost of 10.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Men-at-Arms fight and when they lose, it’s hard on them: they lose 5 Honor for every combat they’re knocked unconscious or fail a Trauma check in due to humiliation.</p><h2>Knight</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a heavy armored tank that inspires others to fight hard.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Knight focuses on shield and armor, and with their larger Vitality Die, they tend to be pretty tanky. Additionally, their Inheritance allows them to get the more expense weapons for free.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d12</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Tactics</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Knights receive the Armor Basic Training (Heavy), Shield Basic Training, and 1 Weapon Basic Training for free. </p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">IMPROVED ADVANCED TRAINING</strong> A Knight is a master of armor and defense, spending years conditioning himself to be able to wear armor and use a shield without breaking a sweat. For Knights Tier 1 Armor and Shield Advanced Training has a Base Cost of 7, Tier 2 has a Base Cost of 8 and Tier 3 a Base Cost of 10.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CHIVALRY</strong> From their strict code comes a strength and confidence that others can only dream of and envy. For the duration of a combat, you gain 1 free use of your Honor Die. You gain an additional free Honor Die for every level you obtain. You can only apply 1 of these bonus Honor Die to a single roll, though that doesn’t stop you adding Honor Dice that you’ve gotten from other sources.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CALL to VALOR</strong> A Knight is a hero and inspires others to rise above. For the duration of a combat all allies gain 1 free use of an Honor Die to share between them. They gain an additional free Honor Die for every 4 levels you’ve obtained. They can only apply 1 of these bonus Honor Dice to a single roll, though that doesn’t stop them adding Honor Dice that they got from other sources, and the Honor Dice is the size of the person’s Honor Dice that redeems it.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INHERITANCE</strong> This character may have had an extra leg up in life, allowing them the opportunity to start with better equipment than others. They gain a free weapon of their choice or a Courser mount and also gain 15 sc for each CrP cashed in at the end of Character Creation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MARTIAL TRAINING</strong> A Knight receives a free Tier 2 Armor or Shield Advanced Training for every level she’s obtained. </p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Knight is a creature of Honor and respects Honor where they find it. They may be killers, but they have a code, whether articulated or not. A Knight may never use a long-ranged weapon on a foe that has greater than Average Honor.</p><h2>Skirmisher</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play an extremely mobile guerilla fighter that gains bonuses for ambushing.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Skirmishers never stay in one place longer than they have to and so are rewarded for constantly being on the move. They’re also adept at making the most of their enemies' disorientation, either from surprise or from the chaos they cause.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Athletics</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Skirmishers gain 1 Basic Weapon Training for free. They also gain 4 free purchases in the Endurance Advanced Skill</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DIRE AMBUSH</strong> Catching an enemy off guard can spread confusion and disorientation that can limit an enemy’s ability to respond. Whenever the Skirmisher hits a surprised enemy, that enemy receives -2 to Attack and Defense for the next 7 seconds. Additionally, should they move above a Walk during this time, they gain an additional -2 for each Movement Category above such for that duration. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">COMBAT READY</strong> A Skirmisher is ready to go at any time. They lower their Initiative Dice down by 1 size per level they’ve obtained, down to a d2. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ATTACK on the RUN</strong> Skirmishers have a special gift when it comes to aiming and moving. Instead of lowering their Attack Dice by 2 per Movement Category when using ranged weapons, they lower it by 1 per Movement Category instead.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GUERILLA FIGHTING</strong> Skirmishers are masters at getting in, doing some damage, and getting out, causing confusion as they move. </p><p style="margin:0px;">If someone attacks the Skirmisher while she is at a Jog or higher, or misses an attack when she disengages with someone, the enemy is left open for two seconds. If hit within that window, then the enemy receives a -3 to Attack for 7 seconds + 1 every level.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RAID TACTICS</strong> Confusion allows those to dart in and out, dealing terrible damage. While receiving penalties from the Skirmisher, enemies are unable to capitalize and get no free attacks when someone disengaged with them.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Skirmisher moves and so quickly loses her edge when pinned down. She receives a -2 for every 5 seconds she hasn’t moved at least 5 ft in combat.</p><h2>Soldier</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a warrior that sticks close to the rest of the company and allows them to adapt more quickly to changing situations.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Bonfire character are not meant to stand alone, and this goes double for the Soldier, who work the best with others. They’re able to shadow others around the battlefield and really focus on being good at one or two weapons.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d8</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Tactics</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Soldiers receive either the Armor Basic Training (Light) and Shield Basic Training or Armor Training (Medium). On top of this, they gain 1 Weapon Basic Training for free as well.</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SMALL UNIT TACTICS</strong> Soldiers work as a team. If they or anyone they’re adjacent uses a tactic that moves them (Shift, Step Back, etc.), the Soldier or their adjacent ally may also use that Tactic with no penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">IMPROVED ADVANCED TRAINING</strong> Soldiers rely on others to make up for their weaknesses, as such, that gives them greater freedom to really specialize in what they’re good at. For Soldiers Tier 1 Weapon Advanced Training have a Base Cost of 6.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BUDDY SYSTEM</strong> Soldiers fight as a unit, moving and acting as one where possible. When an adjacent ally switches Tactics, the Soldier may immediately switch to that Tactic as well. On top of this, they also receive a +1 to their Trauma Threshold, which increased by 1 for every level the soldier has obtained</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MARTIAL TRAINING</strong> A Soldier receives a free Tier 1 Weapon Advanced Training for every level he’s obtained. </p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Soldier focuses so much time drilling with his preferred weapon that he can often forget that principles with one weapon can apply to another. All Tier 3 Weapon Advanced Trainings are 2 CrP more expensive. </p><h2>Tactician</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play someone that is extremely versatile, being able to switch weapons, weapon styles, and tactics on the fly, as well as gaining a greater benefit from resting.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Tactician is a jack of all trades but master of none, focusing on being slightly less skilled at a multitude of weapons. This means that the Tactician will probably have the right weapon for the right enemy. On top of this, the Tactician is skilled at the use of Combat Tactics (hence the name) which allows them to seize opening that others can’t. Overall, the Tactician focuses on versatility.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d8</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Tactics</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Tacticians receive the Armor Basic Training (Medium) and 2 Weapon Basic Trainings for free. </p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">QUICK OR DEAD</strong> A Tactician lives on his wits. While others rely on training, he works on instinct and so can often take advantage of situations that others can’t. By taking 5 Stress, this ability allows the Tactician to change his Combat Tactic, Weapon Style, weapon he is using, regardless of where he is on the Clock or whether or not the dice have been rolled.</p><p style="margin:0px;">He must qualify for the Tactic to use it (so he can’t suddenly Charge if he’s not already at a Run). If you chose to swap out weapons, he is never counted as unarmed, it happens, for all intents and purposes instanteously, and he doesn't need to wait his weapon speed for his next attack - he simply waits the difference between their Recoveries (down to a minimum of 0 seconds).</p><p style="margin:0px;">You can use this ability multiple times, however its Stress price doubles each time you do it between periods of Relaxation, but the Stress it inflicts is lowered by 1 for every 2 levels you’ve obtained to a minimum of 1.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SECOND WIND</strong> Finding the perfect time rest is what the Tactician is all about; he gains 1 additional Vitality for every level he's obtained when he Takes a Breather.</p><p style="margin:0px;">He also knows how to properly cover people when they’re trying to rest. If he is within his Measure + 5 ft of an ally, they gain 1 additional Vitality for every 2 levels he’s obtained when Taking a Breather.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Tactics, 4)</strong> At first level and every level up, Tacticians receive 4 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skill from the Tactics Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL ADEPT</strong> This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Tactician focuses so much on being versatile that their specific specialization suffers. All Tier 1 Weapon Advanced Trainings costs 4 CrP more.</p><h2>Thug</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play someone slips through armor and wears down their opponent so they can't fight back.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Thug is designed to hit hard and make each strike count. As such they have abilities that remove an enemy’s damage reduction and increase the chance to knock someone out.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Streetwise Twice</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thugs receive the Armor Basic Training (Light) and 1 Weapon Basic Training for free. </p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CRITICAL STRIKE</strong> Sometimes the winner isn't the one that can deal out the most pain but the one who knows where to put the pain. At first level, the Thug gains a +1 to effective damage when deciding whether or not an attack triggers a Trauma Check though this extra "damage" isn't added to the d20! roll. This bonus increases by 1 for every other level the Thug has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RUN 'EM RAGGED</strong> At the beginning of combat or a Skill Challenge, the Thug gains a pool of Stress equal to 5 times his level. On a successfully hit or against any Check that's opposed by another person (even if they're unaware of him), he may subtract an amount of Stress from that pool. If he does so, he inflicts that much Stress on his target, which is healed when the person Takes a Breather.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PRECISION ATTACK</strong> The Thug is an expert at making every attack count. At first level, he lowers the DR of his opponent by 1 and an additional 1 for every other level he's obtained. For /d DR, this is subtracted from the final total. </p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Thug never really rises above his street rat origins: the Leadership, Administration, Rally, and Recruiting Advanced Skills all cost double. </p><h2>Vanguard</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play someone that charges in and tries to get as many people to attack them as possible.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Vanguard is the first in the fray, usually engaging multiple enemies at the same time and trying to do as much damage as possible to soften them up for their allies to follow.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d10</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Tactics</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Vanguards receive the Armor Basic Training (Medium) Training and 1 Weapon Basic Training for free. </p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">AGAINST THEM ALL</strong> When they’re in the thick of it is when the Vanguard thrives. The Vanguard gains their Honor Dice to their Attack rolls against 1 opponent when engaged with 2 or more enemies.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">IN, OUT, & AROUND</strong> Knowing how to slip and out of your opponent’s guards allow the Vanguard to get in and out of a jam quickly.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> By gaining 5 Stress, the Vanguard may change their engagement zone with one opponent, without any associated penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, if they’re Threatening their opponent, they could move to Engaged or they could move themselves out to Not Engaged without giving their enemy that free attack.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, if their enemy has successfully employed the In Their Guard Tactic, the Vanguard can move them back out to simply Engaged.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> They can done this multiple times by doubling the Stress gain each time it’s used. This resets after they’ve been able to gain Relaxation. This Stress is also reduced by 1 for every 2 levels the Vanguard has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CROWD CONTROL</strong> Surrounded by enemies, the Vanguard learns to use the crowd against themselves, forcing his enemies to get in each other’s way.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A Vanguard can use his full defense against an additional opponent if the two opponents are adjacent to each other and, should anyone try to disengage with him, he may take 5 Stress, in which case, he gains a free attack against them although this is at half damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FIRST STRIKE</strong> The Vanguard hits hard and hits first. Or at least, they try to.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> At the beginning of combat, Vanguards receive a pool of Measure equal to 1 ft + 1 per every level they’ve obtained. When they first become Engaged with an opponent, they may spend ft from that pool to temporarily increase their Measure to determine who strikes first.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, a level 6 Vanguard would have a pool of 4 ft to work with. If wielding a Stiletto (Measure 1.5 ft) and closing in to Engage with an enemy wielding a Rapier (Measure 4 ft), he could spend 3 ft of it to allow him to get his hit off first, perhaps crippling his enemy before they have change to respond. Doing so would leave him with 1 ft in his pool for the rest of combat.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After that, combat resumes as normal, so he wouldn’t be able to attack the Rapier wielder if he is being Fended Off.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Vanguards are a position of Honor, and they don’t take charging into battle lightly. A Vanguard loses 1 Honor for every battle they’re not the first on either side to land a melee attack.</p><h2>Ashcaller</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a servant that heavily relies on the social aspect of the game.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Ashcaller is a person that carries the legacy of those he loves with him. They’re able to call upon the spirits of the dead to aid him both through a manipulation of the Middle Realm but also as a font of wisdom.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Lore</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Ashcallers receive 2 purchases of the Religion (Ancestors) Advanced Skill for free. </p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SACRED ANCHOR</strong> The Ashcaller can summon the spirit of any person whose bones they carry. This summoning is how the Ashcaller invokes their Miracle.</p><p style="margin:0px;">When an Ashcaller prays to a particular spirit, they enter into a Confrontation with them with a number of rounds equal to the amount of Favor spent, trying to convince them to help. At the end of the Confrontation, the Miracle is invoked and the Ashcaller rolls his Honor Dice with a bonus (or penalty) equal the difference in points. This Confrontation takes 1 second per round.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The spirit, of course, regardless of win or lose, gains the Devotion “Tired of the Ashcaller” with a value of 1, or increasing it by 1 if they already have it.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Additionally, the other ancestor spirits become a bit jealous, gaining the Devotion “Dislikes the Ashcaller” at value of 1, or increasing it by 1 if they already have it.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ANCESTOR COVENANT</strong> As part of their initiation into their order, the Ashcaller is gifted with the bone of one of their Ancestors and tasked with honoring their legacy. This is often a minor ancestor so this bone doesn’t start as a Relic but may become one as a result of play. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Playing the Spirits of the Dead</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Summoned spirits of the dead are not their full personalities but merely shards of what they once were: their strongest characteristics shine through but the subtlety of the once living person is often lost.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, spirits will often only have 3 Characteristics. Often this is just their 3 Strongest Traits but it can also be their Devotions, Flaws, Temperament, or even Goals, or some combination.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Spirits' personalities should make getting them to invoke certain Miracles easier or harder. After all, kind, sweet, Aunt Mildred won't want to summon a plague on a village and so will resist harder and Uncle Vortigern the Mad.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For the first spirit, the players should be encouraged to fill this out and know at least something about the bones of the person they carry.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The Ashcaller may also harvest and sanctify bones, according to how accepted ancestor worship is in the area, allowing them to summon more spirits. If these were NPCs (or even PCs), simply take the 3 Characteristics that you felt best defined them and use that for their spirit.</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TONGUE of the DEAD</strong> Whenever an Ashcaller invokes a Miracle and any of the Honor Dice explode, the next Confrontation with a spirit you get a free use of your Honor Die. This bonus does stack if multiple dice explode.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HONORING & HONORED</strong> The Ancestors smile on those that strengthen their legacy. Whenever an Ashcaller gains Honor, decrease the “Tired of” and “Dislikes” Devotion of their spirits by that amount. Completely reset these Devotions if the Ashcaller goes up an Honor Category.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ETERNAL FAVOR</strong> An Ashcaller is loved for their devotion to their Ancestors beyond others. They add their level to their Max Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DEPARTED COUNCIL</strong> By reading the embers and smoke of their holy fires, the Ashcaller is able to channel the knowledge of those left behind.</p><p style="margin:0px;">By spending an Honor Die, they’re able to summon spirits and use them as an Asset for a Skill Check. The spirit’s Knowledge and Organization is considered Poor, although the Ashcaller can increase one or the other every 3 levels they've obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">They also receive 1 free purchase of the Religion (Ancestors) Advanced Skill at each level up.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Ashcallers have turned their back on the Divines and so are unable to gain any benefits from others spending Favor. Additionally, Miracles invoked against them automatically get their full Honor Dice value.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double specialize in this one.</p><h2>Concert</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to buff up your companions in all areas of the game and buff up yourself in the process.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Concert is a people’s person in the deepest sense. They help others be their best self, buffing others by linking their souls together.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d4 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> According to your Secondary Archertype</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Concerts receive double the Skill & Trainings of your Secondary Archetype.

They add their level to their Max Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SOUL UNITED </strong>The Concert, by using the links between people, is able to strengthen themselves and others.</p><p style="margin:0px;">A person is considered Soul Linked if the Concert has a Devotion that includes a person or vice versa. This can be met with a general Devotion.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If they met both conditions (both have a Devotion to each other), they’re considered Soul Fettered. This doesn’t count if both have a general Devotion to one another: at least one Devotion has to be specific to either the Concert or the other person.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ONE BEING </strong>Any Miracle is considered in her Covenant when invoked on someone the Concert is Soul Linked to.</p><p style="margin:0px;">On top of this, if it is someone they’re Soul Fettered with, she gains half the Favor (rounded down) spent this way back.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">WE'RE ALL FRIENDS </strong>The Concert has a unique ability to just chill everyone out and get them to relax, even around age old enemies. If someone who she is Soul Linked with is about to be attacked by a sentient foe, before the first blow is actually thrown, the Concert can spend 5 Favor to initiate a Confrontation to get both sides to back down.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If it is someone she is Soul Fettered to, she may do this for only 3 Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MUSE </strong>The Concert inspires others to rise to the challenge just solely based on her strong belief in them. When starting a Confrontation, Combat, or Skill Challenge, the Concert receives 2 uses of her Honor Dice that she may give to anyone she is Soul Linked to.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If they are Soul Fettered, that person receives the max value of the dice when they redeem them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">She gains an additional Honor Die for every level she’s obtained.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;">A Concert’s being is linked to others and so their fates are entwined. If someone who is Soul Linked to the Concert dies, they gain 20 Stress each time.</p><p style="margin:0px;">However, if someone they are Soul Fettered with dies, they gain no extra Vitality and no Vitality Die roll on level up. If more than one dies, that subtract 1 for each person from their Max Vitality.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double specialize in this one.</p><h2>Liminalist</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to command other beings that enhance or expand your skill set and don’t mind taking the risk that they might burst free and kill you.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The liminalist is one that reaches, not for the other realms, but for the endless, shapeless void between them, pulling the demons from them and bending them to their will. A liminalistis to a demonologist what a theoretical mathematician is to an engineer.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Lore</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Liminalists are seekers of unknowable things. They receive 3 free purchases of Religion (All).</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HEWN OBLIVION</strong> The liminalist, though a combination of will and exploitation of Divine power, is able to pull demons, leftovers of creation, from the aetherial void and binds them to his will. Demon stats can be found in the <a target="_blank" href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/">Bonfire Bestiary</a>.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The liminalist spends 1 or more Favor to bind a demon with a Circle value equal to the total of his roll. So, if he spent 2 Favor in the summoning, with an Honor Dice of a d6!, he could get a demon between Circles 2 and 12.</p><p style="margin:0px;">There are different types and categories of demons, each with different abilities that can get a specific job. Some are brutish and stupid, while others are cunning and skillful. Some come linked with certain symbols, such as gateways or the birth of children, that give them powers related to them.</p><table style="width:350px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="3" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Demon Summoned </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll (d20)</td><td>Demon</td><td>Short Description</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/99/gm" target="_blank">Amayon</a></td><td>Hurts those around it</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/116/gm" target="_blank">Astaroth</a></td><td>Inflicts Stress</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/98/gm" target="_blank">Belphegor</a></td><td>Spawns smaller demons</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/56/gm" target="_blank">Deumusian</a></td><td>Scares those around it</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5 - 6</td><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/53/gm" target="_blank">Gargoyle</a></td><td>Big ol' brutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td style="background: #222;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;">7</td><td style="background: #222;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"></td><td style="background: #222;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;">Jack of All Trades</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>8 - 9</td><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/55/gm" target="_blank">Imp</a></td><td>Manipulators</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>10</td><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/250/gm" target="_blank">Incubus/Succubus</a></td><td>Changes people's personality</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>11</td><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/63/gm" target="_blank">Janusarian</a></td><td>Unkillable in zone</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>12 - 13</td><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/251/gm" target="_blank">Merihem</a></td><td>Repositions things/people around</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>14</td><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/105/gm" target="_blank">Padagogus</a></td><td>Fortifies your Resolve</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>15 - 16</td><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/60/gm" target="_blank">Sabnock</a></td><td>Weakens those around it</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>17 - 18</td><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/64/gm" target="_blank">Scox</a></td><td>Mailer demon</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>19 - 20</td><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/54/gm" target="_blank">Sycophant</a></td><td>Secret Tellers</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The demons pulled are randomly rolled on the Demon Summoned table.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The demon appears within 5 ft of the summoner and rolls a d3 initiative dice.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Demons are notorious shapeshifters and beguilers but through this ability, the liminalist is able to force them (somewhat) into a single shape, though this is often a grotesque and twiced form.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Demons, even relatively dumb ones, are intelligent creatures and will struggle to overcome their bindings. Anytime you change a demon’s command, the demon rolls a d20 + its Circle (and the Circle of any other demons controlled by the same liminialist) in a one round Confrontation. </p><p style="margin:0px;">If it wins, the summoner loses control and the demon goes rogue. See the A Demon Unbound sidebar for more information.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Any Servant in the area can try and gain control of it; spending Favor and rolling Honor Dice. If the total is greater than the rogue demon’s Circle, they gain control... for now.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Demons are wily creatures, always trying to find loopholes in their orders and while there are implicit bindings in the summon that prevent obvious loophole breaching, they’ll do the bare minimum of what’s asked of them.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This binding does make them more susceptible to suggestion as well and others may enter into a Confrontation with the demon to get it to do or reveal things, on one condition: it can’t go against their summoner’s orders.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, a demon ordered to patrol a hall can be forced to reveal information about its master or how many people are in each room, but it can’t be forced by others to stop patrolling (or even not attack the players, should it be told to kill anyone in the hall).</p><p style="margin:0px;">The summon lasts for 1 minute but can be increased by 1 minute if the control spends additional Favor. Demons are forced to stay within eyesight of their current controller.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the liminalist dies or suffers a Mental Breakdown, the demon is unsummoned.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>A Demon Unbound</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A demon that’s escaped its bindings is a terrible thing as their full power is unleashed, directed at the one who brought them into existence.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The demon gets back the full complement of its shapeshifting powers.

After doing so, it’ll try to do as much damage as it possibly can before it winks out of existence.</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SEE the UNSEEN</strong> As a liminalist, you learn to get a feel for the void and what ‘could be’ in the ‘is not’ that can be. He can modify his d20 roll on the Demon Summoned table by an amount equal to his level in either direction.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HUBRIS BRIDLED</strong> The worst thing a liminal can do is summon a demon from a higher Circle than he has power to control and so he learns to fight his confidence and learn to control his ego, projecting this to others around him.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The liminalist can take Stress to raise or lower Honor Dice results by a like amount, however, he can never lower it below 1 or raise it above its max value</p><p style="margin:0px;">He may also do so for others but takes twice the Stress.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CLERICAL ERROR</strong> The Liminalist doesn’t ascribe to one faith but games the system to gain favor because he knows the Divines’ celestial accountants aren’t keeping that close of an eye on things. They increase their Max Favor by their level</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">They also gain Favor as Servants do, although the performance of the rituals is more lip service than actual belief in most cases and so don’t start with the normal Devotion that Servants start with.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Liminalists who focus on their craft have more powerful bindings but that can be a problem. Should the liminalist die or suffer a Mental Break, any demons he has bound become unbound instead of simply becoming unsummoned.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their cavalier attitude towards faith, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double specialize in this one, nor become Anointed.</p><h2>Paragon Acolyte </h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want a smaller but stronger array of powers that benefits greater from your Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These people take hero worship to another level and by emulating their idols, they convince the already shaky reality that they’re the reincarnation of said hero, giving them amazing powers. </p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d8 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Any One Relating to His Hero's Story</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PARAGON’S LEGACY </strong>The Paragon Acolyte can channel his hero, allowing him to recreate events from their life on a smaller scale. The player selects 5 feats that the hero performed during their lifetime and, whenever they invoke Miracles related to one or more of those feats, they increase the Honor Dice they get from Favor by 1 size. It is increased an additional size for every 4 levels the Paragon Acolyte has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LIKE STORIES of OLD </strong>Feeling the power of the old stories rush through your veins, it allows you to soar higher than mortals dare. Whenever you roll the maximum amount on their Honor Dice, you gain another use of your Honor Die.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MANIFEST DESTINY </strong>Fate is always on the side of the hero, then and now. By spending a point of Favor, you can turn one of your Confrontation, Skill Check, or Defense die to its maximum size. You can do this once at first level and an additional time every 2 levels.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MANTLE HERO </strong>At the end of each day, the Paragon Acolyte receives 1 Favor for every point of Reputation in their strongest Reputation, minimum 1, but does not gain Favor by Holy Days or Sacrifices.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GREATER BEING </strong>Linked to their hero’s spirit, they can increase the amount of Favor they can get. Their Max Favor is their Honor Category + their level.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Every hero has a weakness that can lead to their downfall. During character creation, the Paragon Acolyte tells the story of the hero’s downfall. When it becomes relevant, the Paragon Acolyte cannot spend Honor or Honor Dice to help him.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double specialize in this one.</p><h2>Priest</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want your companions to benefit from their Favor more and receivea kick-back for doing so.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Priests focus on shaping Miracles on other people rather than themselves, making them a good support Archetype for other classes.

This ability doesn’t work on those Anointed into other cults. He gains half, rounded down, of the Favor spent this way back.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HONOR of the DIVINES</strong> If you or someone you've spent Favor on rolls the maximum value on your Honor Die while invoking a Miracle, you gain an extra use of your Honor Die.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FAVORED of the DIVINES</strong> The Priest’s mission isn’t a selfish one, but it does have some benefits and they’re loved for their devotion to their Divines beyond others. They add their level to their Max Favor. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CATECHISM</strong> By studying the holy texts, the Priest is about to discern the will of the Divines and better understand the Higher Realms. They receive a free purchase of the Religion (Divines) Advanced Skill at first level and at every level up.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> A Priest has sworn themselves to a Higher Power and as a token of their Covenant, they must select a taboo; an action or thing they must never do, such as cut their hair or eat meat. This must be appropriate to the Divine and be approved by the GM before play begins.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double specialize in this one.</p><h2>Shaman</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a servant with a more solid list of Miracles that affect the world beyond just bonuses.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A Shaman is one who invested their second soul into a Bonfire, thus they carry a part of the flame with them where they go. They are a divine elementalist, with a larger selection of Miracles than your average priest but they’re not pulled from the traditional Miracle list.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d10</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Lore</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LINKED to the BONFIRE </strong>The Shaman has the soul of the Bonfire and so is a generator of holy power that flows from them. They increase their Max Favor by their level.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SHAPE YMIR </strong>The Shaman shapes the world through their connection to it and so their Miracles are more immediate than other servants. They may pray for any spell from the Animism, Calling, and Occultism Traditions with their Honor Dice from Favor behaving like a Channeling Dice. </p><p style="margin:0px;">Miracles cast this way always have a Shape of Circle and an Origin of Aura. These Rudiments do not increase the Drain of the spell and the Shaman can choose to have it effect either those linked to the Shaman (i.e. anointed into the fire cult) or everyone else.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PURIFY the MORTAL COIL </strong>The Shaman can remove their mortal coil to manifest their true nature but doing so may kill them. For every 2 Vitality the Shaman sacrifices, they gain 1 temporary special Favor. </p><p style="margin:0px;">This Favor doesn’t count towards your Current Favor and can be immediately added to keep a Miracle going. All damage dealt this way goes on one Wound and the Favor is wasted if not used before the next sun rise.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MANTLE of FIRE </strong>The Shaman’s power projects out from him to protect those he wishes. By sacrificing 1 Vitality, the Shaman can make something within the Shape of a Miracle immune to its affect.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MASTER of the DARK </strong>The Shaman can read the flames and ashes, gaining insight into things others can’t see. Starting at 2nd level and at every other level up after that, the Shaman receives either 1 free purchase of either the Lore or Survival Skill Suite.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;">The Shaman literally glows with inner light, giving enemies a +10 to spot them.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Additionally, when they invoke a Miracle, the Bonfire swells within them, making 10 ft around them Bright Illumination. The Shaman is penalized as well if they don’t close their eyes, though there’s no permanent damage.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double specialize in this one.</p><h2>Symbolist</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to spend your Favor to gain permanent bonuses to help you and your companions adapt as needs be.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Symbolist is the word and the law, both being sacred to him. His worships reality itself and channels the innate power in the corpse of Ymir to shun magic and miracles. He grips the law so tightly as to bend it to his will.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d10 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Survival</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LINKED to the BONES of YMIR </strong>Harnessing the divine energies of the Middle Realm, the Symbolist is able to become a part of the world in a more real way. He gains Favor equal to his Honor Category + 1/2 his level. Unlike other Servants, he can’t gain additional Favor through the normal means (sacrifices and holy days): this Favor is static and only increases with level.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MARKS of the EARTH </strong>Through ceremony and ritual, the Symbolist is able to invoke Miracles that are normally reserved only for the Divines. Given an hour, the Symbolist can endow a mark on him or another person. During the ceremony, he selects a certain number of his Favor and “locks” into the mark.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Doing so essentially invokes a Miracle on that person, however, unlike a normal Miracle, it persists for as long as the person marked wishes it and there is a distinct chance of failure: the Symbolist must roll over 10 on their Honor Dice. He gains an additional roll of the Honor Dice for every Favor he locks in.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the Miracle is unsuccessfully invoked at the end of the ceremony, the mark, and the Miracle by extension, didn’t take and that Favor is freed once more, however, the Symbolist can’t try the ceremony again on that person until they increase an Honor Category.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If it was, that Miracle active, blessing the Symbolist and/or marked person. The mark can only be removed at the will of the person or Symbolist and can’t be removed by normal means (so washing won’t get rid of it). The Favor is “locked” and can't be used for other marks and Miracles until released. </p><p style="margin:0px;">Unlike normal, the Miracle doesn’t give the full Honor Dice as a bonus whenever the Miracle is applicable: instead the person gains a +1 (or -1 depending on what the person wants when they roll) for each Favor locked into that Miracle when applicable. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Like normal Miracles, however, this can modify things you normally couldn’t, like Movement speed or Knock-Back, or what-have-you. The GM may also increase this bonus if he feels it is appropriate (getting a +1 to your equipment breaking isn’t that big of a deal so increasing it to +3 wouldn’t be out of place, for example).</p><p style="margin:0px;">Should the Symbolist die, all his marks are released. Also, should the Symbolist’s Favor drop below their currently locked Favor (from lowering an Honor Category, for example) they’re forced to unlock one of their marks and dispel a Miracle. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LAW of AVERAGES </strong>The Symbolist is a pillar of certainty in a sea of chaos. If the Symbolist rolled under the average on a dice, he may gain 5 Stress and the next roll someone makes gives them a +1 bonus to their roll. Additionally, if he rolled over the average, he may spend 5 Stress for the next roll to be at a -1 penalty.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This bonus is also increased by 1 for every 2 levels they’ve obtained and can negate perfect attacks and defenses.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CONDUIT of REALITY </strong>The Symbolist can invoke Miracles from the following Covenants: Dream, Guardians, Adversity, Battle, Beauty, Fate, Fire, Home, Honor. He is unable to invoke any Miracles outside of these Covenants, even for the normal price.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;">By anchoring themselves to the Bones of Ymir, the Symbolist cuts off his connection to the God’s Realm in a way: other Servants are unable to invoke beneficial Miracles on him and they also increase their Honor Dice by 1 size when invoking destructive Miracles on him.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double specialize in this one. Also, due to their inherent link with Ymir, they're unable to take a Weird-Adept Archetype as their Secondary. </p><h2>Advocate</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to be supportive in a Confrontation without being the center of attention and responsibility.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While other Socialites like the limelight, the Advocate doesn’t mind playing second fiddle and in fact, thrives there. When supporting others in a Confrontation, the Advocates gets a lot of bonuses.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d4</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Lore</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RETHINK AN ARGUMENT </strong>Advocates tend to be more introspective than other Socialites, which allows them to wait on an argument until they can articulate their thoughts more clearly. When making an Appeal, the Advocate can put aside a number of dice that they rolled a 1 on equal to 3 + their level. This dice isn't added to their total for points or Stress.</p><p style="margin:0px;">They can later bring it back in, adding it to another round’s total with a +2 for every round that dice has sat out. This can bring the total over the dice's maximum value.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FLANKING POINT </strong>The Advocate can really use his unassuming nature to really hammer home a point. If multiple pieces of Evidence are presented in a round of a Confrontation, and the opposition picks yours to respond to, you gain an additional point.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">WALLFLOWER BLOOM </strong>The Advocate really shines when not center stage. When making an Appeal, if you roll the least number of dice (or are tied for it) and your side wins the round, gain an additional point.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HELPER'S PORTION </strong>Sometimes the reward is just to know you've helped. When the person that started the Confrontation is dividing out the Honor, if the Advocate takes the least amount, they gain 1 Honor + 1 for every 5 levels they've obtained.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Advocates can kind of lock up when they’re in the driver's seat. When they’re the only one in a Confrontation, Evidence and Appeals give them 1 less point.</p><h2>Armiger</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a battlefield commander, using the Morale rules to win combats.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Armiger is one that has been granted the right to bear a cost of arms, either their personal sigil or their liege lord. People are naturally drawn to these individuals and they find their strength in the support of this crowd.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d8 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Tactics</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RISING the BANNER </strong>Armigers attract the best and brightest to their banner. As such, they gain double the bonus to attracting followers from Honor. On top of this, they only gain the -1 to their roll for every other follower they attract.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FORCE of PERSONALITY </strong>No matter the situation, Armigers are able to leverage their likeable personalities. When Rallying a broken person, they may gain another use of their Honor Die and an additional Honor Dice for every 2 levels. This additional use of the Honor Dice lasts until the end of the Confrontation and doesn’t need to be spent right then.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STANDARD </strong>An Armiger has the right to bear a heraldic crest that identifies him. He may emblazon this on a banner or his shield, but by having it proudly displayed, while he is still fighting, all his allies use his Honor category to determine their starting Morale category.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Tactics, 4) </strong>At first level and every level up, Armigers receive 4 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skills from the Tactics Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Armigers are standards of the people and when they fail to live up to that, they’re judged more harshly. If the Armiger is forced to retreat from a Combat or Confrontation for any reason, they lose 5 Honor.</p><h2>Champion</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a traditional hero: beating foes through force of spirit and inspiring others to do the same.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A crusader for a cause, paladin of the king, a knight errant questing for his love. These are Champions. Their oaths and devotions are the weapons they wield and, from sacrifice to a cause greater than themselves, strength. </p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d10 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Tactics</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Champions gain Armor Basic Training (Heavy), Shield Basic Training and 1 free Weapon Basic Training. </p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">POWER of DEVOTION </strong>Zeal is a powerful force and can sharpen the mind and bring out the best in someone when properly channelled. Whenever redeeming an Honor Die while doing something related to their Devotion, they also add that Devotion to the roll.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FANATICAL PRESENCE </strong>Your oath is sacred and only death can prevent you from the fulfilment of your duty and others can see that. This total faith in your path makes the going easier for others. </p><p style="margin:0px;">During a Morale Confrontation that relates to the Champion’s Devotion, whenever an argument involves him, one of those dice gets a +1. This is increased by 1 for every level you’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Multiple Devotions don’t stack in this case. You may add this bonus regardless of whether or not you're the party captain and anyone on the Champion’s side is eligible for this benefit.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SOLEMNITY of CAUSE </strong>A Champion considers his obligations with a solemn contemplation and as his beliefs are challenged, the stronger they grow. Whenever he wins an Appeal that involves at least 1 of his Devotions, he takes no Stress.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">IRON RESOLVE </strong>Nothing, not even apparent defeat, can sway a Champion from their course of action. In a Confrontation that is related to at least one of their Devotions, when the Champion loses an Appeal, they gain a +1 to their next round if they Appeal again. This is increased by 1 for every 3 levels they've obtained. they </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Those on his side are also bolstered by this surety and gain the same bonus if the Champion gets it.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Champions take their oaths very seriously and don’t take new ones on lightly. Anytime they can purchase Devotions for CrP, the price of a new Devotion is 10 CrP x the number of Devotions the Champion already has.</p><h2>Diplomat</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play someone that bends others to their will through sheer force of personality.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Diplomat is a strong-willed character that makes the most of emotional Appeals: learning how to use them to great effect to sway his opponents.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Streetwise</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CAREFUL WORDING</strong> A Diplomat has the grace and tact to be able to reword an argument in the most effective way possible. The Diplomat can spend 10 Stress to reroll all of the dice for one side when they Appeal in a Confrontation. For his and his allies’ Characteristics, take the higher of the two results. For the enemy, take the lower of the two results.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STRONG PERSONALITY</strong> As a Diplomat grows, she becomes more confident in who she is and what she wants. At 2nd level and every other level after that, a Diplomat can increase the strength of one of their Traits by 1 dice (up to a d20) or they save them and cash in two of these increases for a new weak Trait starting at 1d4.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GREY EMINENCE</strong> In his arena, he is king, and nothing can shake him. For the duration of a Confrontation the Diplomat gains 1 free use of their Honor Die. They gain an additional free Honor Die for every level they’ve obtained. They can only apply 1 of these bonus Honor Dice to a single roll, though that doesn’t stop them adding Honor Dice that they got from other sources.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RESILIENT CHARACTER</strong> Surprisingly, those with the strongest personalities have the greatest power to resist abuse and not second guess themselves. When using an Appeal, half the Stress you would get.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Diplomats put their reputation on the table whenever they engage in a Confrontation. They lose 5 Honor whenever they lose a Confrontation.</p><h2>Foil</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play someone that convinces people through using their weaknesses against them and protecting yourself from their charms.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Foil focuses on using the other person when convincing them of something. He can steal the opponent’s dice in Confrontation and when things get tough, he can tag in another person to take on the Confrontation.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Streetwise</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MIRRORING</strong> By agreeing with your enemy, you can sometimes lull them into a false sense of security, causing them to lower their guard. A Foil can take 10 Stress and make a guess at a Characteristic his opponent has. If he’s correct, that Characteristic loses 1 dice for every 2 levels he’s obtained, down to 1 dice. He also automatically receives points equal to the dice removed.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So a level 7 Foil who correctly guesses a 3d6! characteristic, lowers it to d6! and gains 2 points.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GASLIGHTING</strong> A Foil’s particularly devious when it comes to other’s flaws and weaknesses. A Foil can guess a character’s Mental or Behavioral Flaw. If correct, and they successfully use it in an Appeal, they gain an additional point.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CONTEMPT</strong> A Foil can pretend he doesn't care, thus shaking his opponent's confidence in their arguments. If a Foil starts the round, Appeals, and loses, they can take 10 Stress. If they do, they gain half the points they would have gotten if they had succeeded. They reduce the Stress inflicted by 1 for every 4 levels they've obtained, down to 3 Stress.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SHIFT BLAME</strong> There’s strength in numbers, especially when those numbers are used as a shield. When his side makes a successful Appeal, the Foil can sacrifice 1 Honor to choose whose dice gets added as points instead of going with the lowest. That person, however, is thrown headfirst into a stressful situation, suddenly becoming the center of attention, giving them 3 Stress for every point of difference between what they’re added and what would have been added. This penalty is lowered by 1 Stress for every 10 levels the Foil has obtained.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Foils are so good at mirroring others that they often forget to reflect on themselves; It takes them twice as much CrP to improve their Traits.</p><h2>Fusilier</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play someone that uses firearms to stun and overpower people through use of fear.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Firearms are new and exciting but also dangerous. While not as damaging or as far reaching as other ranged weapons, they do terrify in a primal way, a thing that Fusiliers have learned to exploit.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d6 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Tactics</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Fusiliers receive 1 free Weapon Basic Training for the firearm of their choice.</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STANDARD ISSUE </strong>Fusiliers often tend to gain their firearms from the military and a lot of time, they take them home (much to the chagrin of the quartermasters). They may start the game with 4 handgonnes, 10 fire lances, or a hakenbuchse.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">OF LEAD & POWDER </strong>A Fusilier trains with guns, pushing their skills to the limit, allowing to get creative in their uses. Fusiliers may wield and fire handgonnes with one hand and count as small weapons for the 2 1 Handed Weapons Style. They’re also able to deploy a hakenbuchse’s trip pod in 2 seconds instead of 5 seconds and they get 2 uses out of each fire lance.</p><p style="margin:0px;">With all firearms, a Fusilier can light the brand in a swift motion, taking no time at all, lowering the firing time by 4 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ROAR of the BEAST </strong>There’s something terrifying of the smell of smoke and the rage of fire and a Fusilier knows how to use this to their advantage. If in a Morale Confrontation, enemies that are Appealing to those flinching gain an extra 2d6!.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Further, those that travel with the Fusilier gain an immunity to this after a combat and lower their flinch times against all firearms by 1 second per shot they weren't hit by.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Roar of the Beast Lite</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">If you’re not running the Morale rules, here is another option to not have the Fusilier nerfed because of this change:</p><p style="margin:0px;">The Fusilier can select a number of flinched enemies up to his Warfare Skill Rank to gain an additional -2 to their Defense for each Wound Category they've dropped.</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BOOMSTICK </strong>By adding just a little something to the powder mix, the Fusilier can make that bang from the firearm going off exceptionally loud. The minimum amount of time an enemy flinches from a Fusilier’s firearm going off increases by 1 for every 2 levels they’ve obtained. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MARTIAL TRAINING </strong>A Fusilier receives a Tier 1 Weapon Advanced Training in the Firearm of his choice for every level he’s obtained.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Due to all the gunfire a Fusilier has been around, they have a harder time hearing than others. The Listening Advanced Skill costs 6 CrP instead of 4.</p><h2>Knave</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play someone that beats their opponents though sheer force of apathy.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Knave is a mean villain - mean in the sense of being crude and villain in the sense of being low class, but unlike others, the Knave doesn’t seem to mind and that’s where their strength lies.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d6 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> None</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">UNIMPRESSED </strong>A Knave knows that silly titles are only there to buttress insecurities. Others gain no benefit from their Reputation, Honor, and/or Stat Confrontation Dice when engaging in Confrontation with the Knave. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PLAYING DIRTY </strong>While others hoard their precious Honor for the sake of not having people talk bad about them, the Knave doesn’t care and so she can use her as a weapon. A Knave can lose 3 Honor to increase one of her Characteristic dice by 1 and reroll all non-exploded dice she’s using in her Appeal that round. She can also increase 1 extra dice by 1 size for every 2 levels she’s obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FOOL’S BEARING </strong>By deflating yourself, you can deflate others. Each round, a Knave can pay X Honor or X points to lower all non-Flaw Characteristic dice by X sizes for everyone in that round (including the Knave and her allies). This follows the normal rules if a Characteristic would drop below a d4!, however, the Knave’s never drop below 1d4!.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This ability shrinks a single dice an additional size for every 2 levels she’s obtained.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Knaves aren’t really heroes at the end of the day, even if they try to be. Shrink their Honor Dice by 1 size.</p><h2>Monteback</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play someone that convinces their opponents through fast talking: coming on strong for a quick win but suffering in the long game.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Mountebank is one of tricks and quick thinking. He relies on dazing the person with words, hoping they won’t take the time to catch onto his tricks.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d4 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Streetwise</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FAST TALKER </strong>If you can get someone to agree quickly, so much the better. You start the Confrontation gaining an additional d8! to each Appeal but shrinks one size each round, down to a d4!. You gain an additional dice for every 2 levels you've obtained. You only get this bonus if you choose to Appeal that round. The dice shrinks even if you use Evidence that round.</p><p style="margin:0px;">However, if you’re unable to convince your target by that time, the next round you receive no bonus dice from this ability and each round after, you instead reduce the size of one of your dice if you Appeal.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">JACK of ALL TRADES </strong>You don’t have to know everything but you should act like you do. The Mountebank has mastered that art and so they increase the dice they gain from their Skills by 1 size.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">KEEP 'EM OFF BALANCE </strong>The Mountebank knows how to make a mark sweat and uses that pressure to have them start making rash decisions in his favor. If your opponents lose an Appeal, they also add the lowest dice's result in Stress.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Streetwise, 4) </strong>At first level and every level up, Montebacks receive 4 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skills from the Streetwise Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Mountebank is the devil in disguise and his untrustworthy nature makes him never quite sure if you can trust him. You lower everyone’s Racial Preference towards you by 1, bottoming out at Hate.</p><h2>Noble</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to debuff your enemy while gaining strength through winning Appeals.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Noble is typically aloof and hard to impress and so can convince people simply by making them unsure about their conviction, shrinking their dice in Confrontation. </p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Tactics</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">NOBLE BEARING</strong> By reminding others of their lower station in life, you can remind them just how petty their needs are. You inflict 1 point of Stress for every dice your opponent(s) brings in each round up to your level.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RETHINK YOUR WORDS</strong> Assail the throne of a noble’s grace with caution, for you are at his will and pleasure. Whenever the Noble, or one of his allies, wins an Appeal, you may force the enemy to reroll their dice on their next Appeal, taking the worse of the two results.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ROYAL BACKGROUND</strong> Nobles form an elite class of society, giving them a strong sense of self and confidence. Their Devotion to their clan starts at a 4 and they gain the Trait “Noble Heritage” at 3d6! for free. This doesn't replace any of their 5 free Traits and may be increased in the normal matter.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If the player wants, they can swap out the "Noble Heritage" Trait for the "Parvenu" Trait, representing either new nobility or a non-noble bloodline, such as being the scion of a wealthy merchant family. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GOOD BREEDING</strong> In victory or defeat, the Noble is gracious. At the end of a Confrontation, the Noble receives 1 Honor automatically. This bonus is increased by 1 Honor for every 2 levels he’s obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;">All his allies also automatically gain 1 Honor, though this doesn’t increase as the Noble levels.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INHERITANCE</strong> This character may have had an extra leg up in life, allowing them the opportunity to start with better equipment than others. They gain a free weapon of their choice or a Courser mount and also gain 15 sc for each CrP cashed in at the end of Character Creation.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Nobility is a collective illusion and so those of royal blood, no matter how limited strive to keep that illusion in place. Nobles lose 1 Honor and gain 1 Stress whenever they're not referred to by either their proper title, "my lord", or "sir". </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In the case of Parvenus, the character is more aware of their low-born roots and will do everything they can to separate themselves from the commoner class. As such, they're required to spend 10% of their coin (both starting and acquired during play) on nice clothes and lodgings (however, they gain no additional Relaxation for doing so). </p><h2>Officer</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to use the Morale rules to allow your company to adapt and rally to snatch the from the jaws of defeat.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The cunning Officer is able to read a battlefield like a book and with a single command, swings the fulcrum of battle in her side’s favor. He is the party leader and the standard to which others flock.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d6 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Tactics</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Officers receive the Armor Basic Training (Light)</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MOMENTUM </strong>Those in leadership can often turn a small victory into a large one. Whenever the Officer wins a round, they gain a bonus d6! the next round for each successive time they’ve done so.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FOG of WAR </strong>The Art of War is the art of information and the Officer knows how to wage that war. Against a Panicked person (or group), Evidence gives an additional point.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ESPRIT de CORPS </strong>The Officer can push others to limits they didn’t know they had in them to fight for their comrades. At first level, while the Officer is conscious, any ally that can see him gains a positive Devotion to the company starting at strength 1. This is increased by 1 for every level he’s obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BATTLEFIELD MANEUVERING </strong>Careful planning and strategic movement can help win over the day. The Officer can sacrifice an Honor Die to allow anyone on the battlefield to either switch Tactics or Shift without a penalty at that second. This can be done after a roll is made and the results given and the Officer can either sacrifice his Honor Die or one that the person who is benefiting from this ability has.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MARTIAL TRAINING </strong>An Officer receives her choice of a free Tier 2 Armor, Shield, or Weapon Advanced Training for every 2 levels she’s obtained.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Officers don’t really know how to fight alone and may take the better part of valor in a combat. When fighting alone, Officer characters gain 1 Stress every time they put up dice in a Morale Confrontation.</p><h2>Philosopher</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to become stronger as you let your opponent win rounds so that you can crush them with one fell swoop.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Philosopher reserves his strength, allowing his opponent in a Confrontation to escalate for him. While others suffer strain from not meeting the argument straight on, the Philosopher uses it to his advantage.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Lore</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RHETORIC</strong> By knowing the fundamentals of how to form an argument, a Philosopher can stop and point out the logical fallacies in another’s argument (even if they’re not there). A Philosopher can flip a dice over one side, to a lower number. They can flip an additional dice for every level they’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, they can move a 7 on a d10 to 5, 3, 2, but not 10, or a 6 on a d12 to a 2 or 3 but not up to 8, 9, or 12.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STOIC</strong> Philosophers are trained so that petty things like emotion arguments don’t have as strong an effect on them and their opponent can tell. If a Philosopher uses Evidence against an opponent's Appeal or his opponent Appeals and he responds with Evidence, he gains an additional point.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CLOSING REMARKS</strong> Regardless of whether they want to hear it or not, the Philosopher knows how to make you listen. Whenever a Philosopher pushes, he gains 1 point.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PRACTICE DEBATE</strong> Even if you don’t get what you want, you can often get practice for next time. Whenever a Philosopher loses a round, they gain 1 use of their Honor Die in their next round. This increases by 1 use for every other level they obtain, however, they can’t use more than 1 per round.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Philosopher tries to not let things get personal: when they make an Appeal, they don't half their Stress gain if they win.</p><h2>Rascal</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play some that relies more on the circumstances of the Confrontation than on their raw stats.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Rascal gains a few skills, but their main strength is their cunning ability to avert danger, though any brush with death leaves him shaken. On top of this, in Confrontation, the Rascal wins because he can leverage circumstances in his favor.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Trades</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LUCKY </strong> The Rascal is naturally blessed with the ability to get out of trouble and use that adrenaline that comes as death comes near to dodge the grim reaper and keep running. After the results are given, the Rascal can take 2 Stress to modify his results by 1. These may be done with the following conditions:</p><ul><li>They can never be used to make you a better fighter. Stress gained this way can only be used to dodge death or escape a bad situation but never to make your character a superman. </li><li>The character must think of a situation that saves his rear end, something that happens to him that’s to his advantage. </li></ul><p style="margin:0px;">The key here is that it can’t be impossible, but it can be highly improbable. The chandelier rope breaking right at that moment separating him from a blood thirsty guard, a pigeon flying across an archer’s view intercepting an arrow, etc. are all acceptable.</p><p style="margin:0px;">It can’t be the result of skill. Him deflecting the blade with his hand like a badass is right out.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Should the character be unable to think of a scenario that fits both of these criteria, he’s unable to gain Stress to save himself.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GREASE PAINT & GLITTER</strong> If there's one thing that a Rascal knows, it’s how to position themselves in the most advantageous light. In a Confrontation, once per round, the Rascal increases one dice 1 size. This is increased by 1 for every level he’s obtained. This can either be his or his allies’, it doesn’t matter.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Once he’s increased all dice in a round 1 size, he may then go back and increase them again, and so on.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Any, 2)</strong> At first level and every level other up, Rascals receive 2 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skill. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Rascal favors no weapons as they tend to get you killed: all Weapon Advanced Trainings are 2 CrP more expensive per Tier (Tier 1: 11 CrP, Tier 2: 16 CrP, Tier 3: 22 CrP).</p><h2>Augur</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to a weird-adept with a wider of rotating range of strengths, giving some breathe of powers and greater power.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">An Augur is one who watches the stars. The times and seasons are linked to the swirl of constellations overhead and the ways of magic. Those that watch them carefully can harness their power. An Augur gains bonuses based on the passage of time, making them change with the times.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d4 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Lore and Weirdcraft</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Augurs receive 2 free purchases of Navigation Advanced Skill and 1 free purchase of Mathematics Advanced Skill.</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Daily Omen Boon </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Day of the Week </td><td>Tradition</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1st</td><td>Animism</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2nd</td><td>Calling</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3rd</td><td>Charm</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4th</td><td>Glamour</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5th</td><td>Investiture</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6th</td><td>Occult</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>7th</td><td>Sortilege</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">JUDICII STELLATUM </strong>As part of their training, Augurs are taught how to harness the magic that drifts down from the stars and constellations. This gives them a steady pool of Spell Points whenever they cast a spell.</p><p style="margin:0px;">At first level, all spells the Augur casts have 7 SPs. This can be spent to modify the spell that they’re shaping. It does take a moment to summon the astral forces, so shaping a spell takes 3 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px;">They increase this by 1 SP for every other level they obtain.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LECTIO COTIDIE </strong>At the beginning of each day, the Augur reads the signs and divines which of the astral winds, and thus which Weird Tradition, is most dominant on that day. This happens in a cycle based on the days of the week.</p><p style="margin:0px;">When shaping a spell from the Tradition linked to the day, the Augur receives an extra d4! SP to spend on that spell. This extra dice is increased by 1 size for every 3 levels they obtain.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you lose track of the day of the week, you’ve lost track of the stars and don’t gain the bonus for that day.</p><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Weekly Omen Boon </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Week of the Month</td><td>Category</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1st</td><td>Shape</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2nd</td><td>Range</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3rd</td><td>Origin</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4th</td><td>All</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SIGNUM HEBDOMADA </strong>The Augur knows each week brings a new fate and with it, new boons. The Augur gains an additional bonus of 1 SP whenever shaping a spell that applies to the particular Rudiment. This is increased by 1 SP for every 5 levels they’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you lose track of which week, you’ve lost track of the stars and don’t gain the bonus for that week.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">VESTIBULUM OMEN </strong>The calends are a special time, when the moon is new and the stars are able to shine; unfiltered, they empower the Augur. The Augur has a pool of 3 Honor Dice that they can use for spell shaping any time during the month. This pool is increased by 1 Honor Dice for every level they’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This pool refreshes on the first day of every month.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you miss the first day of the month, you’ve lost track of the stars and don’t gain the bonus for that month.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LIBRO DIEBUS </strong>An Augur keeps a Book of Days where they store their divination knowledge. They gain 3 Rudiments of their choice at 1st level and an additional Rudiment every other level.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Weirdcraft & Navigation) </strong>At first level and every other level up, Augurs receive a free purchase of the Weirdcraft Skill Suite and Navigation Advanced Skill.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Augurs are extremely superstitious since everything is controlled by fate and the stars. Bad luck means a bad fate. They take 1 Stress every time they roll a 1 on a d20. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to take another Weird-Adept Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double specialize in their Primary.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Augur Double Specialist</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>JUDICII STELLATUM</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This starts at 7 SP base and is increased by 1.5 SPs (rounded down) per level.</p><h4>LECTIO COTIDIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Incease the number of SPs you get to a d6!.</p><h4>SIGNUM HEBDOMADA</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This is increased to 1 additional SP for every 3 levels you’ve obtained.</p><h4>LIBRO DIEBUS</h4><p style="margin:0px;">This is increased to 2 additional Rudiments with a new one every level.</p></td></tr></table><h2>Mage</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to raw power and flexibility.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The mage is one that allows himself to be buffeted by the astral winds and so channels great power but also is in great danger. The mage has the most raw power of the Weird-Adept Archetypes but it could backfire on him.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> According to your Secondary Archetype</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">WILD MAGIC SHAPING</strong> The Mage is able to channel the power of the stars, harnessing it and creating magical energy. While doing so the weird-adept must stand still and he glows with light, being illuminated by a column that reaches above them. This light is equivalent to a candle’s brightness.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">After 7 seconds, the Mage gains their Spell Points. Unlike other Archetypes of this type, however, a lot is left up to chance. The Mage rolls randomly for the Shape, Origin, and Range of the spell and d3! SP that they can spend on the Effect (which you select after learning what the Shape, Origin, and Range is). </p><p style="margin:0px;">They also gain an additional d3! “free” SP that can either be spent on the Effect, or to modify what they rolled on the tables on a 1 to 1 basis.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When considering Drain, the Mage only has to worry about the Effect’s Base Drain and so, essentially, gets the other Rudiments for free. As long as he has more Spell Points than Drain, he can keep the spell cast.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can also suffer weirdburn from keeping a spell up too long: if your spell’s Drain is greater than your current SP, the spell is still cast, but you and everyone within 200 ft takes 1 Stress for every point you’re over.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Going back to the above example: if you have 9 SP, and you keep the spell up for 15 seconds, you and those within 200 ft take 4 Stress ( 20 - 3 - 3 ). Should you continue to keep the spell up, you’d take an additional 3 Stress every 5 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">It is recommended that even though you don’t technically get those points until after that 7 second duration, that you roll everything ahead of time and figure out what you’re going to cast ahead of time. The GM is not obliged to stop the count for you if you haven’t been spending those 7 seconds wisely.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can stop shaping at any time; however, you take Stress equal to the amount of SP you have left - Weird is a powerful primal force and once unleashed, it is not stopped without cost. You also cannot cast or keep up a spell and Channel. This doesn’t remove those SP but the Mage does lose 1 SP every 6 seconds.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Channeling in Armor</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Wild Magic Users (Mages and Wizards) both draw their power from the stars. As such, anything that gets between them and this, makes channeling more difficult. While this is negligible while wearing clothing, armor, being a mite bit heavier, does slowdown Spell Point acquisition. </p><ul><li>Light Armor increases channeling time by 5.</li><li>Medium Armor increases it by 10.</li><li>Heavy Armor increase it by 15.</li></ul></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">WILD SURGE CONDUIT</strong> The Mage puts himself more at danger than other casts but is able to experience greater power. If the total number of SP from channeling is greater than 4 + level, a Wild Surge occurs. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> In addition to whatever happens with the spell, it is also recast. The new version, however, is Circularly Shaped at Full Range and with an Origin of either Aura or Far, as the weird-adept sees fit. They also take Stress equal to how much they were over.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EMPOWERED CHANNELING</strong> A Mage relies on an innate understanding of the flow of magic through his body and overtime he can increase its effectiveness.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Not starting at first level but happening after every level he's obtained, the Mage can either increase the size of any 1 of his dice by 1, or decrease her channeling time by 1, down to a minimum of 3 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px;">She may also, independently, decrease her channel time by 1 but this costs an amount of CrP equal to X, down to a minimum of 3 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ASTRAL FULCRUM</strong> There is nothing between the Mage and the raw Weird and that allows her to force what others can't. The Mage can take 10 Stress in which case they gain all their SP in the first second. This is in addition to the normal Fallout.</p><p style="margin:0px;">However, they still need to complete the channeling: if they don't, they receive an additional 10 Stress. As they become more powerful, however, they learn how to mitigate that danger, lowering the Stress inflicted by 1 for every 4 levels they've obtained. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">UNLEARN DOGMA</strong> As the Mage grows in power, the can set aside things that are holding them back. At each level up, a Mage can forget a non-Effect Rudiment. If they do so, they gain an Effect Rudiment of their choice.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">METHOD of LOCI</strong> A Mage gains 2 new Rudiments at 1st level but an additional Rudiment every other level. Any new Rudiments must be Effect Rudiments.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> The Mage rejects martial prowess as a role and so all Weapon Advanced Trainings are 2 CrP more expensive per Tier (Tier 1: 11 CrP, Tier 2: 16 CrP, Tier 3: 22 CrP).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to take another Weird-Adept Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double specialize in their Primary.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Mage Double Specialist</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> double specialize Mages gain 2 purchases of the Weirdcraft Skill Suite.</p><h4>WILD MAGIC SHAPING</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Increase all channeling dice to d4!s</p><h4>WILD SURGE CONDUIT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Increase your Wild Surge threshold becomes 5 + (level * 2)</p><h4>EMPOWERED CHANNELING</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This ability now starts at first level.

This allows him to cast quickly and consistently but limits the amount and flexibility of his spells.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Lore and Weirdcraft</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Runegalders receive 3 free purchases of Literacy in their native language.</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">VANCIAN SHAPING</strong> The Runegalder chains the power of spells to various runes that he then invests, sealing them with his blood until he’s ready to release them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Every 24 hours, the Runegalder can seal 3 spells. He can also bind an additional spell for every 3 levels he’s obtained. This means that he may cast those spells at any time by simply speaking the rune they’re linked to, once prepared. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Speaking the rune releases it from its binding so speaking the same rune again before he’s resealed it will not recast the spell - the spell’s power is gone. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> He may cast a spell multiple times per day, but he’ll need to bind each instance of the spell to a different rune. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Speaking a rune in this way doesn’t affect the Runegalder and so he ignores Fallout to himself.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> He may also unseal a rune without actually shaping it, but he is not able to immediately reseal a new rune right after.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The Runegalder's magic is 'dead' and so is less potent than other types of magic, thus allowing some to shrug off their spells.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> When shaping a spell, the Runegalder rolls a d20! + 10 + their level. All those that would be affected by the spell roll a d20! + their level. If their total is above the Runegalder's, they're unaffected by his magic. This roll is made regardless of whether or not the person wants to be affected by the spell.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ARCANE COMPONENTS</strong> The Runegalder gains 3 additional random Rudiments and gains an additional 2 Rudiments every level.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GRIMOIRE</strong> This is the Runegalder’s spell book and keeps the spells that he binds to runes. Unlike a normal spell book, however, the spells are scribed in meteorite ink and blood that seals their magic power in the text itself. This means that the Runegalder’s Grimoire does the channeling latently for him.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At first level he constructs 3 spells using his known Rudiments and an additional 1 at level up. These spells can’t have a Drain greater than 7 + their level (so at 1st level, his spells can only have a Drain of 8) when it is scribed into the Grimoire. A spell’s Rudiments cannot be redistributed and changed: spells in the Grimoire are immutable.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that spells cast by the Runegalder only last their Interval unless their Effect is stacked, in which case, it either increases that Interval by a like amount or gains the Stacking bonus but not both. This is decided when the spell is cast. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Spells inscribed at different levels count as completely different spells and must be sealed to different runes. So, if the Runegalder has a 8 SP Flash Grenade and a 11 SP Flash Grenade, he would need two runes to cast both. He couldn’t simply bind “Flash Grenade” to one rune and then choose which he wanted to use in the moment.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Weirdcraft, 1)</strong> Through the course of her career, a Runegalder seeks to further their knowledge of the occult. They receive 1 free purchase of the Weirdcraft Skill Suite at every other level up. </p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> The Runegalder uses his body as a prison for latent magical energies which wears on a person over time. He ages at twice the normal rate.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to take another Weird-Adept Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double specialize in their Primary.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Runegalder Double Specialist</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>VANCIAN CASTING</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can seal a new spell every other level.</p><h4>ARCANE COMPONENTS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You start with 1 additional Rudiment and gain 3 each level.</p><h4>GRIMOIRE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> New spells have 8 + ( level x 2 ) Drain.</p><h4>SKILL FOCUS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Skill Focus is increased to every level. </p></td></tr></table><h2>Sourcerer</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to extremely power and flexibility but don't mind waiting around a bit for it.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">An ethereal being in a physical world, the Sourcerer draws his magic from an internal well within them. As such, they don’t cast spells so much as manifest them into existence. Unlike most other weird-adepts, the Sourcerer doesn’t rely on luck or Astral Winds, but instead generates power from within. This is a slower process making Sourcerers less helpful in the moment but more powerful given a bit of time.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d8 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> According to your Secondary Archetype</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MANIFEST SOURCERY </strong>Whether born under a certain constellation or through a long-lost bloodline, the Sourcerer has a special connection to the Painted World. They’re a font of magic, making them very powerful and very dangerous.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Drawing from within is consistent but takes time. Every 10 seconds, you add the 10s digit of the number of SP’s in your pool into your SP pool, minimum 1. So, after 50 seconds of manifesting, you would have 15 SPs ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 ).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Sourcerers don’t suffer from normal Fallout and can continue to Manifest for as long as they want, however, this power comes with a price. Being a conduit of the unworldly saps their life and every time they add SPs to their pool, they take damage equal to that pool.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Manifesting requires light concentration so they can do other things while shaping spells but if it’s something particularly difficult (like combat or doing mathematics), the Manifesting time is doubled. You can also stop Manifesting at any time but your SP pool will atrophy at the rate of 1 SP per 6 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">POWER OVERWHELMING </strong>As the Sourcerer grows, they also grow in power and can stay between two worlds longer. They reduce the amount of damage taken from manifesting by 9 + their level, though they always take at least 1 damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRADITION ATTUNED </strong>A Sourcerer is always attuned to a certain Weird Tradition and, at 1st level, knows all Effects from that Tradition and 1 random Rudiment of each type besides that. Starting at 2nd, you can choose a second Tradition. At these level and at every other level you obtain, you may select an Effect from that secondary Tradition or roll for another random Rudiment. At 11th level you gain access to a 3rd Tradition's Effects.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAGON SKIN </strong>A Sourcerer is a well of Weird, therefore, to some exact, absorb Weird that is thrown at them but it comes at a cost. When affected by a spell, the Sourcerer can lower the effect by 1 at 1st level and an additional 1 for every 4 levels they obtain.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Because of Sourcerer is basically a native of another world, their bodies do all they can to shlof off the mortal coil. Every Wound takes 1 day longer to heal</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to take another Weird-Adept Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double specialize in their Primary.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Sourcerer Double Specialist</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>POWER OVERWHELMING</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is increased to 12 + twice your level.</p><h4>TRADITION ATTUNED</h4><p style="margin:0px;">At 1st level you are attuned to 2 Traditions, knowing all the Effects from both. Starting at 2nd level and another time at 8th level and another time at 15th, you can choose another Tradition. At this level and at every level you obtain, you may select an Effect from any available Tradition.</p></td></tr></table><h2>Speaker</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to shape spells quickly and consistently.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There is the surface level of things and then there’s how things truly are. By striking the threads of magic, a Speaker is able to touch reality and bend it to her will, changing it as she pleases. The Speaker has a variable amount of Spell Points available to her, giving her some breathing room as well as more flexibility when it comes to shaping times.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d4 </p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Lore</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Speakers also have a natural talent for languages: They quadruple their Lore when determining their starting Language Rank.</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ADAMIC COMMAND </strong>To know the First Language is to know the words of the Divines, heard as whispers on the mortal plane. Speakers spend decades learning to correctly pronounce each syllable and its meaning; learning the subtleties that each inflection brings. As they grow in power, the words they speak take on more power.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Once the Speaker decides what their spell will look like (Shape, Origin, Range, and Effect) and what its Drain will be, they roll 3d3 (note that these dice don’t explode). If the result is higher than the Drain cost, the spell comes into being. The Speaker is free to roll less dice and/or smaller dice, if they so desire.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Speaking words of power takes actually time, specifically 1 seconds per dice rolled. </p><p style="margin:0px;">If 3 - your current Stress Penalty (minimum 1) of the dice you roll come up as 1s, the Speaker has made a major mispronunciation and the GM rolls for a random Effect from a random Tradition but with otherwise identical dimensions to the spell the Speaker wished to cast.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Since Speakers are not channeling astral power like other magic users, the Stress they gain from Fallout is 6 - their level + number of spells cast in the last 24 hours down to a minimum of 1.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DICTION TRAINING </strong>As a Speaker gains experience, she becomes more able to get around the trickier parts of the Divine syntax and so can add more force and power to her spells. Every level, she may either add another d3 to her Adamic dice pool or increase the size of one of those dice by 1 (up to a d12).</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LEXICON </strong>A Speaker starts with 2 additional random power words or Rudiments to start off and they gain an additional Rudiment every other level.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (special) </strong>Through the course of her career, a Speaker seeks to further their knowledge of the occult. They receive 1 free purchase of the Weirdcraft Skill Suite and 2 free purchases of the Language Advanced Skill at every level up. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">POLYGLOT </strong>Speakers naturally pick up languages in ways that others can only dream of. The Language Advanced Skill is half cost for them and any language that the polyglot gains Rank 4 or above in is considered a native tongue for them.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Obviously, Speakers can’t have the Stutterer or Mute Flaws. Gaining either of those two Flaws prevents them from shaping.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to take another Weird-Adept Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double specialize in their Primary.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Speaker Double Specialist</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>ADAMIC COMMAND</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">your starting Adamic dice pool starts at a 4d4s</p><h4>DICTION TRAINING</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You add d4s instead.

As such, they tend to be social pariahs because the process of extracting that magic is random and painful. Still all power has a price and Warlocks happily pay it.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d10</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Weirdcraft Twice</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">THE BLOOD PACT </strong>The Warlock has performed a secret ritual and has joined the Blood Pact, allowing a Warlock to instantly pull Weird from the living creatures around him. </p><p style="margin:0px;">This gives him 1 SP per second per person within 10 ft but deals that amount of damage to those he’s pulling from. This includes himself but he also takes an additional damage per second. </p><p style="margin:0px;">This blood pull is unaffected by armor but is blocked by other living beings, if they’re closer. Essentially, if a person would give you cover from a ranged attack, they also protect you from the blood pull.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Otherwise these SPs act exactly like normal and can be instantly used to shape a spell.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This amount is increased by 1 SP and damage per second every 6 levels.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This pull is not stealthy at all as the blood is torn from skin and flies to the Warlock. Additionally, it is not fully controlled and goes on for a minimum of d4! Seconds. A warlock may shape and keep up a spell even when pulling.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">WASTE NOT </strong>Even when not actively pulling, blood has an innate attraction to the Warlock.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Anytime anyone within 25 ft of him takes damage, part of the spilled blood is drawn to the Warlock, giving him 1 SP + 1 for every 6 levels he's obtained. This is regardless of how much damage was dealt.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Otherwise, this behaves (but doesn't stacks with) the blood pull (including being blocked by others).</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN the VESSEL </strong>A Warlock’s own blood is seething in the Weird of the Pact: each damage he takes from the blood pull is worth double the SPs.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FONT of POWER </strong>A Warlock’s spells doesn’t come from an outside force but is, instead, projected from him. This results in the Aura Origin having a Drain of 0, instead of 5 and the Touch Origin having a Drain of 1.</p><p style="margin:0px;">However, the Far and Near Origins have their Drains increased by 1.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE </strong>A Warlock gains 2 additional random Rudiment at 1st level and an additional Rudiment every other level.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Weirdcraft, 1)</strong> Through the course of her career, a Warlock seeks to further their knowledge of the occult. They receive 1 free purchase of the Weirdcraft Skill Suite at every other level up.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;">People don’t like Blood Magic. By most people’s standards, even at its best, it’s dangerous and random and so Warlocks are not well liked. Warlocks are considered 1 level lower on the Racial Preference table for everyone that knows they’re a Warlock.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to take another Weird-Adept Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double specialize in their Primary.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Warlock Double Specialist</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>THE BLOOD PACT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You now pull blood (and SP) from every person within 20 ft and increases by 1 Damage and SP for every 5 levels.</p><h4>FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Increased to 0 additional Rudiments and a new one every level.</p></td></tr></table><h2>Wizard</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you power and flexibility but don't mind sacrificing a bit of power for a bit more stability.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Wizards, make no mistake, are still Wild Magic weird-adepts and are no wimps when it comes to raw power, but unlike the Mage that completely gives himself over to the whims of magic, the Wizard uses his study and training to lower the hills and increase the troughs, giving more consistency.</p><h4>VITALITY DIE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h4>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAIN SKILL SUITE</strong> Weirdcraft</p><h4>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">WILD MAGIC SHAPING</strong> The Wizard is able to channel the power of the stars, harnessing it and creating magical energy. While doing so the weird-adept must stand still and he glows with light, being illuminated by a column that reaches above them. This light is equivalent to a candle’s brightness.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">After 10 seconds, the Wizard gains d10! Spell Points (SP), which is a single pool that can be spent to shape the Weird on the fly out of any Rudiments he knows. The spell’s Drain is then subtracted from the Wizard’s Spell Point pool when he casts it and at the Interval. As long as he has more Spell Points than Drain, he can keep the spell cast.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Let’s say that you have a spell that is Shaped like a Cone (Drain 3), has a Range of Full (Drain 0), an Origin of Aura (Drain 3) and has a Base Drain of 2 from its Effect. That means the Drain of that spell is 8 ( 3 + 0 + 3 + 2 ).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If it has an Interval of 30 seconds, when you cast that spell, it costs you 8 SP and then, after 30 seconds, it costs you another 8 SP, for a total of 16. As long as you have SPs you can keep a spell active.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can also suffer weirdburn from keeping a spell up too long: if your spell’s Drain is greater than your current SP, the spell is still cast, but you and everyone within 200 ft takes 1 Stress for every point you’re over.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">It is recommended that even though you don’t technically get those points until after that 10 second duration, that you roll your SP ahead of time and figure out what you’re going to cast ahead of time. The GM is not obliged to stop the count for you if you haven’t been spending those 10 seconds wisely.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This channeling dice increased by 1 for every other level the Wizard has obtained. </p><p style="margin:0px;">You can stop shaping at any time; however, you take Stress equal to the amount of SP you have left - Weird is a powerful primal force and once unleashed, it is not stopped without cost. You also cannot cast or keep up a spell and Channel. This doesn’t remove those SP but the Wizard does lose 1 SP every 6 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Wild Magic comes with some additional dangers, however. Should the Wizard roll more SPs than 8 + his level, he suffers a Wild Surge but untrained in it, he is unable to use it to the best of his ability.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The spell is recast, however, its Circularly Shaped at Full Range and with an Aura Origin. They also take Stress equal to how much they were over.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">WEIRD MEDIUM</strong> The Wizard is a bit more impersonal with his relationship with the Weird, preferring to use Weird Mediums as the fulcrum of the Weird around him. At first level, he may choose one from the following list.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Should he find himself without his Weird Medium, he’s in trouble. His threshold for Wild Surges drops to 5 regardless of level.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Weird Mediums List</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>ANCESTOR BONES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> This magic user was gifted the bones of his ancestors, powerful wizards from ages past that are able to give their descendants some of their prowess. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At 1st level, a Wizard with Ancestor Bones as his Weird Medium lowers his channeling time by 1 second. He also lowers it by an additional second for every 5 levels he’s obtained, down to a minimum of 2.</p><h4>INVESTED ITEM</h4><p style="margin:0px;">This Medium comes in many shapes and sizes. By binding her soul to an item, a Wizard can make a metal object an extension of her power.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While holding this item, she may cast any spell as if the hand was free. For armor, the Invested Item offsets the penalty to shaping by 1 Drain for every 5 levels the Wizard has obtained. This can only offset the penalty, and never lower it below the base speed. For weapons and other items, they may also cast spells with a Touch Origin on a successful hit, storing one spell indefinitely until it’s used. If it is a ranged weapon, Touch spells are cast from the ammunition. Needless to say, this a much favored Medium of battle mages.</p><h4>ORB</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These are often called a Seer’s Orb, as this is favored by Wizards of the Occultism Tradition. Orbs are often glass, but those of other materials are not uncommon, though they tend to be precious metals or stones. The only requirement is that they’re larger than your fist. Orbs bend reality, gaining an automatic increase to any spell’s Range by half of its Base Range for every 3 levels of the Wizard.</p><h4>SPELL BOOK</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> A large tome, traditionally, the spell book is the favored Medium of the more scholarly magic user.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The Spell Book is not simply incantations jotted down or notes about rituals - it’s an extension of the Wizard’s brain. As long as he’s touching it, he automatically gains the ability to shape using any Rudiment in the book.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Wizards who select this Weird Medium gain 2 extra starting Rudiments, however, these are only stored in their Book. They also gain a new Rudiment every 3 levels, which is also stored there, meaning that if they lose the book, they lose those Rudiments.</p><h4>SPELL TATTOOS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Painted Men are common in the frozen tundraof Askemark. The metal heavy ink serves to store channeled magic and allows the Wizard to keep invested power for longer.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">With Spell Tattoos, the time it takes to lose a SP when not channeling is doubled for every 4 levels the Wizard has obtained. This also lowers the Stress taken from stopping a spell with SP left by 1 per every 3 levels. </p><h4>STAVE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Traditionally made of holly wood harvested with a silver sickle at midnight on the night of the new moon, Staves serve as extensions of the Wizard’s soul, much like an Invested Item, but because it’s not made of metal, it holds different properties.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While welding a Stave in one hand, the Wizard offsets the Fallout from shaping a spell by 1 every 3 levels the Wizard has obtained. This can't lower it below 0, however, but does extend to the people within 50 ft of them as well.</p><h4>FAMILIAR</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Favored by the traveling Wizard, a familiar is a small animal or homunculus that is bonded to the Wizard’s soul. Because of this connection, a wizard can see and hear through their Familiar’s eyes and ears as well as channel SP through it, as long as it is standing still, allowing the Wizard full movement even when channeling.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Familiars are small sized creatures. The player selects three candidates, but the GM makes the final decision on which creature came when she called, unless the Wizard opts to have built herself a homunculus.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Wizard who would get 2 Weird Mediums but chooses familiar twice may select a medium or large sized creature or any small sized creature of her choice.</p><h4>WAND</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> The Wand is an exact tool, a tool of precision. It is favored by more aggressive spell weird-adepts because it makes their spells hard to resist. </p><p style="margin:0px;">While shaping with a Wand, the Wizard gains a free Stack of one of the spell’s Effect Rudiments for every 3 levels they’ve obtained.</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SYLLABUS</strong> A Wizard gains 3 random Rudiments at 1st level and an additional Rudiment every other level.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL FOCUS (Weirdcraft, 1)</strong> Through the course of her career, a Wizard seeks to further their knowledge of the occult. They receive 1 free purchase of the Weirdcraft Skill Suite at every other level up. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL ADEPT</strong> This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h4>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> The Wizard’s study can sometimes leave her with a divorced relationship to reality that can make them somewhat obtuse. When bringing in Traits, Wizards reroll their highest dice roll. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to take another Weird-Adept Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double specialize in their Primary.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Wizard Double Specialist</h3></th></tr><tr><td><h4>WILD MAGIC SHAPING</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Channeling dice is increased to d20! and increases every level.

These flaws are often a way of dealing with troubles in their life, letting off Stress or rationalizing their behavior to others. Other times they’re artifacts of a hard life, like a soldier whose missing an arm. </p><h2>Benefits & Penalties</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Flaws in Bonfire are a tradeoff: they’ll make your character less able to do things in certain arenas or harder to be around but allow you to invest in abilities and powers elsewhere. This is represented by the CrP bonus that you get from taking Flaws</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Another bonus is that by overcoming a character's Flaws, a person gains confidence and Honor. Essentially, this means by applying your Flaws to your detriment, your character becomes stronger. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is done very simply by saying that you think a Flaw would make something harder for your character in this situation and then giving yourself a -d4! to your Skill, Attack, or Defense roll or giving your opponent d4! Leverage. Regardless of whether or not you succeed, they gain Honor equal to your penalty. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The GM may award more Honor or inflict you with a larger penalty as seems appropriate for the situation. After all, if it's something your character really struggles with and it gives them a -d8!, it makes sense that they would get an equivalent amount of Honor for overcoming the challenge. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, note that if you're the one to bring up your Flaws, you get Honor regardless but if the GM has to do so, you only get Honor if you succeed so it is always better to bring them up yourself (unless you have a very inattentive GM). </p><h2>Gaining Flaws</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are two ways to select Flaws: Rolling and Cherry Picking. Rolling gives you more CrP per Flaw but Cherry Picking gives you more control. </p><h4>ROLLING FLAWS</h4><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Flaw Table Table </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll (d100)</td><td>Table</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1 - 25</td><td>Background</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>26 - 50</td><td>Behavioral</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>51 - 75</td><td>Mental</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>76 - 100</td><td>Physical</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"> Roll on the first table below and then roll on the corresponding table.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You can spend 1 CrP to reroll at any time but once you’ve committed to a table, you have to roll on that table.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Each Flaw after the first loses 5 CrP of its value per previous Flaw to a minimum of 0 CrP received.

So, the 3rd Flaw you pick will be at a -30 CrP.</p><h2>Flaw Descriptions</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While most Flaws can be reasonably looked up, some might need some clarification which is why they're listed below or additional penalties. We've also provided some handy tables you might find useful for figuring out the details of that Flaw. </p><h4>ADDICT</h4><table style="width:150px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Addiction </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll D20</td><td>Name</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1 - 5</td><td>Drugs</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6 - 10</td><td>Sex</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>11 - 15</td><td>Gambling</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>16 - 20</td><td>Alcohol</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can, of course, choose whatever addiction you feel fits your character, but we’ve provided a table you can use to generate one for you.</p><h4>ATHEIST</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The way of the divine is a mysterious path, and someone mistake it for no path at all. Some refuse to believe that intelligent higher powers exist and so forfeit some of the blessings while others find worshipping such beings laughable, like giving reverence to the biggest bully on the block.</p><h4>BLIND, TOTAL</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> This character has completely lost his sight. He sees only pure white or pure black, unable to sense any movement around him.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> In melee combat, they defend and attack with a 1d6! And ranged combat is right out, however, if you insist, you’ll be attacking and defending with a 1d4, so enjoy your fumbles, you stubborn bastard.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Additionally, any Skill Challenges involving sight halves the person’s Skill Rank.</p><h4>BOAR FACED</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is the polite way of say that someone is ugly as sin. This could be the result of parentage or a bad accident, either way, people don’t like being around them or dealing with them. As mean as it might be, people judge books by their covers.</p><h4>DARK SECRET</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There’s something that this character is hiding and she’s worried that she’ll be found out. She’ll jealously guard every aspect of her life if she can for fear of being found out.</p><h4>DEBTOR</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has gotten into trouble financially. This character starts with 5d20 + 150 sc of debt instead of gaining a like amount to start off with. All their equipment much then be purchased on a credit of 50 sc that is also taken out of their debt. If they don’t make payments on it, they may find themselves on the bad end of the law or the loan shark they borrowed from.</p><h4>DERANGED</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> There are holes in this character’s brains and he’s starting to slip into madness. The nature of this neurosis is up to the character.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The character doesn’t suffer the effects of Stress until it matches his Wisdom score, at that point, he has an episode and doubles his total Stress. Once, he’s recovered (dropped his Stress back down below his Wisdom), he suffers a permanent reduction 1 to both his Intellect and Wisdom.</p><h4>EPILEPTIC</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Something is not wired up just right in this character’s brain and that causes them to have little short-outs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When something triggers a Trauma check for the character, or their Stress reaches above their Int score, there is a 1 in 8 chance of the character having a seizure, in which they’re completely helpless for the next 1d3 minutes.</p><h4>EXCOMMUNICATED</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> This character has invoked the wrath of an angry god, calling down divide judgement on his head. This is more commonly a member of the faithful who's fallen away or lost his way or willfully defies the cult’s teachings, but less commonly, it’s an outsider whose been declared an enemy of the faith. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Excommunicated members cannot gain the blessings of any miracles related to a single Covenant. Additionally, baleful invocations from priests of the deity that excommunicated them half their threshold.</p><h4>FATED</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Certain character’s bear a strange sign on them that marks them for doom. The cruel strings of fate weave together to form a noose for them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At creation, the GM rolls 1d8!. This is the number of sessions the character has before Fate begins to sharpen her shears. After that point, the character takes extra damage each time they're hit equal to how many sessions have passed since then.</p><h4>FERAL</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> The wild and untamed lands are home to frontier men and families. Occasionally, children escape and are raised only by the wild, occasionally wolves.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Feral characters still receive any free skills from their Archetype but any additional skills they try to pick up can only be from the Atheletics and Survival Skill Suites.</p><h4>HALF-LIFE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has died and forced back to life, maybe against his will. This character is affected by the Force Bind Spirit spell, though the Duration is set to 1d4! - 2 (minimum 1) years and a day. Why he came back is up to you. Perhaps he had some unfinished business or perhaps he was targeted accidently. In any case, now he lives a half-life.</p><h4>HAUNTED</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Mostly commonly, this character has done something to dishonor his clan and has been since been haunted by one of their ancestors, displeased by their actions.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The spirit takes the corporeal form of a rotting corpse wearing its death mask, bothering the possessed at all hours to restore his family’s honor and stop being such a failure. The ancestor will do nothing to protect their descendant and often make life harder for them when they can. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Unfortunately, decades, if not centuries, in the grave have made the ancestor more than a bit senile. Even if the character is to obtain Great Honor, the ancestor doesn’t care; what it really wants is for the character to sacrifice themselves in a heroic way or perform suicide.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This character doesn’t heal Stress naturally and loses 1 Honor at the end of every session.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Flaw may be paid off for half cost if the character has lasted 2 sessions in Great Honor, however it goes back up to full price if they slip out of Great Honor later.</p><h4>HEMOPHILIC</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These guys love to bleed. Well, they may not love it but they certainly do it a lot more than the rest of us. They take an additional d4 points of damage every time they're wounded. </p><h4>IDIOT SAVANT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character was born gifted. Or in other words, they were born with the ability to understand something but nothing else. This character picks an Advanced Skill or Training; all other Skills and Trainings cost double. The chosen Skill or Training now costs half.</p><h4>IMPISH</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character loves getting into trouble, mostly through pranks of all kinds. While she’s not inherently malicious, her pranks tend to be unwelcome.</p><h4>IMPOTENT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If this character was a tree, he’d have particularly softwood, if you know what I mean. His lack of confidence in his abilities in the bedroom, tend to affect the other parts of his life, often snowballing; he loses an additional Honor for every 10 lost.</p><h4>INBRED</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Often a curse of the nobility that get too close to their cousins, inbreeding can stunt the mental capacity of their offspring. Typically, this is pretty mild for the most part, but it means that increasing this character’s Intellect score costs double.</p><h4>LIMP</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Something isn’t working just right, whether from a birth defect or a war wound, causing this character to hobble along at a slower pace. Characters with a limp move at half their speed at all times.</p><h4>MISSING ARM</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Most likely this is the result of some terrible accident or horrific war wound, though some people are born with an arm missing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character with this Flaw is unable to wield two handed weapons, employ bows or crossbows, or anything else that needs two hands.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Flaw may be rolled multiple times, with the second time you take this flaw making it worth 60 CrP, as it prevents the character from using any weapons, and makes them unable to cast spells with Somatic components</p><h4>MISSING EAR</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> While it won’t limit your ability to hear entirely, the shape of the ear does make it easier to hear things.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The first time you roll this Flaw, all Listening Checks take a penalty of -3.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The second time, all Listening checks are 3 Difficulties harder and your initiative dice becomes one worse. You gain 25 CrPs instead of 20 (in addition to the CrPs from the first time you picked this Flaw up). </p><h4>MISSING EYE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> You can imagine that a character with one eye gone would have an issue with his depth perception. You’d be correct.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The first time a character gains this Flaw, he automatically attacks second when engaging in melee, even if his weapon has the greater reach and everything is counted as two range categories further for ranged weaponry.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The second time this Flaw is rolled, the penalties are replaced by those of the Blind, Total Flaw and he gains an additional 25 CrP.</p><h4>MONOTHEIST</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> For this character, there is only one true god, and all other divines are false deities or the work of devils.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> He will refuse help from pagan clerics and is bound to only miracles within his chosen Covenant. </p><h4>MULE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While they may not show it, this character is the result of mixed ancestry and something about their unnatural genesis makes them sterile, unable to promulgate. While this will definitely make creating a dynasty an issue, certain carousers may hardly consider this a Flaw.</p><h4>NO DEPTH PERCEPTION</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has a hard time reading distances making it so that he automatically attacks second when engaging in melee combat, even if his weapon has the greater reach and everything is counted as two range categories further for ranged weaponry.</p><h4>OPUSPHOBIA</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Opusphobia is defined by a fear or repulsion of a certain career choice. Someone with this Flaw may dislike horse merchants because he sees them all at crooks or innkeepers because he’s afraid they’re working with the Thieves Guilds.</p><h4>PASSIONLESS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Whether because of imbalance in their brain or they haven’t really found that thing that calls to them, a Passionless character has problems really being interested in any given subject they try to engage in. Any situation die they gain from their Skills are always one smaller.</p><h4>POOR</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some characters don’t have the financial leg up that others have. These characters must choose the following Equipment Kit during Step 11 of Character Creation. </p><table style="width:350px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="3" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Pauper's Kit </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Item</td><td>Size</td><td>Sellback</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1 S weapon</td><td>S</td><td>15</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Breeches, Good Linen, Light, Fine*</td><td>n/a</td><td>12</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Shirt, Wool, Fine*</td><td>n/a</td><td>13</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Sandals, Leather, Natural Color*</td><td>n/a</td><td>4</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Rations, Person, Day x 3</td><td>3S</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;margin:0px 0px 10px"><td colspan="2">Weight: 1M 1S</td><td>Extra Cash: 1d10! cc</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"></table><h4>PHOBIC</h4><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Phobias </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll D10</td><td>Type</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Animals</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>Being Restrained</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td>Combat</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td>Commitment</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5</td><td>Confrontation</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6</td><td>Magic</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>7</td><td>Religion</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>8</td><td>Sickness</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>9</td><td>The Dead</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>10</td><td>The Opposite Gender</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can, of course, choose whatever fear you feel fits your character, but we’ve provided a table you can use to generate one for you.</p><h4>REFUGEE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Fleeing from their homeland for either economic, religious, or conflict reasons, this character finds themselves in a foreign land. Their flight has forced them to leave much of their belongings behind, halving their starting cash and they tend to be unfamiliar with the language and customs. Their native language is not the main one for this area and the Language and Law of the country they’re fleeing to costs double as they had to learn it under stressful circumstances</p><h4>SECRET IDENTITY</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> For whatever reason, whether they’re hiding from enemies, or they want to put their old life behind them, this character is trying to keep their past a secret. When this flaw is rolls, this character selects one of their Archetypes to be the remnant of their past. Any mention of the Archetypes abilities nets this character 1 Stress.</p><h4>SELF MARTYR</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Life doesn’t feel complete if people don’t know how much you’re sacrificing for them.</p><h4>SENSITIVE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has superb senses compared to others; however it makes it challenging for them to function sometimes as they can just get overloaded.</p><h4>SENSITIVE HEARING</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character is incredibly prone to noise. Other’s normal talking voice sound to them like they’re yelling. You’ll think this would help them suss out noise more effectively but instead it makes it harder to hear because there’s too much sensory input.</p><h4>TALKER</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Whether around the campfire or in stressful situation, this person can’t keep their mouth shut. They’ll just talk and talk, only stopping to take necessary breathes.</p><h4>THRALL</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thralls are those taken in raids or the children of slaves. Technically, they’re ‘free’ but they have a social stigma that follow them. Thralls gain no extra starting cash and half the amount of equipment the kit normally starts with and starting a Confrontation with someone of high status automatically gives you 3 points.</p><h4>VOW of POVERTY</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Middle Realm corrupts and those that wish to come closer to the Gods’ Realm sometimes eschew worldly possessions. This character only keeps enough wealth on them to buy basic food to sustain them for that day, all other wealth is donated to any local cults. They give their goods to the needy, not fellow adventurers. Their Max Favor is increased by 1. </p><h1>Character Vitals</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The purpose of this chapter is to condense all the rules for calculating things about your character so that it can keep the other chapters to just rules you’ll need at the spur of the moment during gameplay. To this end, these rules are missing why they’re important and what you’ll actually use them for, but they do reference the chapter where more is to be found. </p><h2>Stress</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> Working under pressure can get to you. When your crew mates are relying on you to pull out a win, it can mess with your head. Your character can become stressed under these circumstances and stress can later manifest in odd behaviors.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Characters can gain Stress in a lot of ways and those are discussed in their various sections - taking damage, making Skill Checks, etc. - the only one we’ll go over here is from acting against your character’s Characteristics, especially when not playing them would be a huge benefit.</p><h4>STRESS PENALTIES</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Stress affects almost everything you do, making your life harder and your character becomes emotionally pent up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Every 10 points of Stress gives you a penalty of 1 to Defense and Skill Check rolls.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Honor Through Accountability </h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> In the heat of the moment, it’s hard to keep track of all the bonuses and penalties that apply to situations, especially the penalties and especially Stress penalties, which change during the fight.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Because of this, it isn’t required that you apply Stress penalties. However, if you do, you gain 1 Honor and the other side also applies their Stress penalty without that extra Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If the GM reminds you that you need to apply your Stress, you don’t get anything but the penalty.</p></td></tr></table><h4>HEALING STRESS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Stress heals slowly over time but there are several things you can do to speed it up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The first is to give into his nature. By role playing his Flaws in a detrimental way, a character can relieve 1 or more Stress (GM’s option, although it should be about the same amount of Stress healed as was applied by the penalty). This means that when a character sees a situation where his Stress could give him a disadvantage, he can bring it up the GM. If approved, the character heals Stress. The GM may also suggest this option as well if she things the situation warrants it.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The second way is through hobbies. Hobbies are based off your character's Confrontation Characteristics, but besides that, they can be anything, from whoring it up to spending time with the family or working in their shop. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> You gain 1 point of Relaxation for each hour spent on a hobby. You can get additional Relaxtion per hour but you'll need to spend money. Specially, each sc spent per hour gives you an equivalent amount of Relaxation. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, if you're spending time on your hobby (we'll say blacksmithing) and you rent out an actual forge at 2 sc per hour for 3 hours, that would mean that, at the end, you'd gain 9 Relaxation (1 free + 2 for the sc spend * 3 for the number of hours), but it would cost you 6 sc. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Finally, you can indulge in creature comforts. This can be done by buying a nice bedroll or even hiring someone to set up your camp for you so you can relax at the end of the day. The rule of thumb is that each applicable Trait the equipment you have gives you an additional point of Relaxation when applicable. So, an extra soft, double padded, and tailored bedroll will always do you good, but a waterproof tent will really only give you a bonus in inclement weather. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> When your Relaxation matches your current Stress, you heal 1 Stress and your Relaxation drops to 0 again. Yes, that means that the more Stressed you become, the harder it is to decompress yourself. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Also, as an aside here; the Musician and Cooking/Baking Advanced Skills also help heal Stress, so you can look into those.</p><h4>MENTAL BREAKDOWNS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> When your Total Stress is more than your Wis * 3, called your Stress Threshold, you've gotten to the point that you just can't take it anymore. This results in a Mental Breakdown for your character. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When this happens, they do everything in their power to separate themselves from the stressor as quickly as possible. If they're in a scenario that directly threatens their life (like combat or dangling from a cliff), they'll separate themselves as quickly as possible but will pay little attention to their companion's safety. At this point, they're so overwhelmed, they don't really care. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character having a Mental Breakdown can still gain Stress but should they gain enough to go over twice their Stress Threshold, they suffer a heart attack and die.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Even if your character doesn't suffer a heart attack, they'll be shaken and changed from the experience. When they dip below their Stress Threshold again, they lower 2 Traits by 1 dice.</p><h2>Vitality</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Vitality represents how close you are to passing out and dying. It is both your health and stamina. As you take damage, you will get closer to death and gain more penalties based on your Fatigue.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality is divided into 4 categories which are, in order, <strong style="color:#B45F06;">HURT</strong> (H), <strong style="color:#B45F06;">BLOODIED</strong> (B), <strong style="color:#B45F06;">WOUNDED</strong> (W), <strong style="color:#B45F06;">CRITICAL</strong> (C). Each of these make up a fourth of your Vitality.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> To calculate your base Vitality add a roll of your Primary Archetype’s Vitality Die to your Constitution + their Vitality Size Modifier.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Divide that by 4: that’s the amount of the Vitality in each Category. Your Trauma Threshold is twice that (rounded up). Trauma is talked about more in <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/9"]' [queryParams]="{search: '10hgxhgLSKeBpK'}">Chapter 9: Combat</a>.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For fractions on Wound Categories, round up on Hurt but down on the rest.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Record your Vitality Die roll on your character sheet. </p><h4>FATIGUE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> As stated, the more damage you take, the harder the fight becomes. When this happens is noted by your Fatigue</p><p style="margin:0px;">Fatigue is matched to a Wound Category: hitting that Wound Category means that you start rolling your defenses, skill Checks, and Appeals on 1 dice smaller.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Your Fatigue starts a Critical, however, it can be lowered by wearing armor and wielding shields you're not fully trained in.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CHANGING EQUIPMENT WHILE WOUNDED</strong> Since Fatigue is partly determined by the shield you're using, a quick way to up your Fatigue is to simply drop you shield.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Now, the flip side of this is that if you become MORE encumbered while wounded, you could get Fatigued quicker. </p><h4>TAKING A BREATHER</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Pausing and resting for 30 minutes heals you half the damage and Stress (rounded down) that you've take since the last time you've Taken a Breather.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the rest is broken for any reason, you lose all benefit from it.</p><h4>HEALING</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Combat is dangerous. Even if you survive, you could end up with wounds that you carry with you for months on end.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Each time damage is done, it is tracked in a new wound.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Wounds heals at a slow rate. Each point takes a number of days equal to the damage done to heal it 1 point.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, a 5-point wound takes 5 days to become a 4 point wound, which takes 4 days to becomes a 3 point wound, and so on. That means it takes 15 days to completely heal ( 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thankfully, each wound heals simultaneously. So, if you have 3 separate 4 point wounds, you’ll be completely healed by day 10.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RECUPERATION (HEALING WITH RELAXATION)</strong> Another option you can do to speed up long-term healing is to rest and indulge yourself.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If the only Stress your character has is from Wounds, any points of Relaxation gained that day are taken off the days to heal off your Wounds.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This is somewhat limited however since you can only drop a single Wound's days to heal by the amount it had left on that Severity. So, if I have a 10 Severity Wound, with 8 days of healing left, gaining 11 points of Relaxation, would only reduce it to a 9 Severity Wound with 9 days left to heal that day. However, if I also had another Wound, I could use that otherwise wasted Relaxation on it.</p><h2>Honor</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> Honor is a measure how not only how a person measures their own integrity but also how other people see them. Honor isn’t about doing the commonsense thing; it’s about doing the heroic thing. People who run from a fight, even when outnumbered, lose Honor. People who let others talk bad about them and don’t get even lose Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The question of Honor isn’t a question of good and evil; many evil men have been honorable. It’s more about living up to the ideals of your culture and being true to your inner self.</p><h4>BONUS CrP</h4><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Bonus Honor </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Honor of Last Character</td><td>Bonus Crp</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Great Honor</td><td>50</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>High Honor</td><td>35</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Average Honor</td><td>25</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Low Honor</td><td>10</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Dishonor</td><td>0</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"> If this is your first Bonfire character in a campaign, you receive a bonus 25 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’re here because you’ve had a character die, this bonus CrP is based on the Honor category your character was in when they died.</p><h4>STARTING HONOR</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Honor category in which you start is determined by your “Start Honor”, listed under your Charisma. You start at the bottom of the corresponding category.</p><h4>HONOR CATEGORIES & BONUSES</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Honor has its benefits. Confidence allows you to push yourself a little bit more than you otherwise would. During the game, you can spend your Honor points to influence anything, rolls or static metrics, whenever you want on a 1 to 1 basis. Doing so lowers your Honor but might save your character’s life. So, if you roll a 13 and your opponent rolls a 14, you could spend 3 Honor to beat their total. Likewise, if an enemy deals 8 damage to you and you have 6 Honor, you could spend all of it and only take 2 damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Additionally, each category has an Honor Dice, which can be rolled to add or subtract like Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Honor cannot go above 25 or below 0. The size of the Honor Die is also determined at the beginning of session and doesn’t change during play even if the category does.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DISHONOR (0 - 5 Honor, No Honor Die)</strong> The lowest category, this person is unsure that they have what it takes to be a hero and so every decision is laced with hesitation and uncertainty.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LOW HONOR (6 - 10 Honor, d4!)</strong> This character hasn’t really proved anything, one way or another. Others and herself are waiting for her to make her mark on the world.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">AVERAGE HONOR (11 - 15 Honor, d6!)</strong> Having reached this category, the character has shown that they have potential and some follow through.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HIGH HONOR (16 - 20 Honor, d8!)</strong> She has now separated herself from the common rabble and can stand a head above the crowd.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GREAT HONOR (21 - 25 Honor, d10!)</strong> This rare sliver represents those who can perfectly balance being ahead of others but not so much so that they invoke the ire of those below them as well as being confident while not being cocky.</p><h4>END OF SESSION HONOR AWARDS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> At the end of each session, the players will elect each other’s characters for things they think that character deserved Honor for. It is generally poor form to elect yourself but is also reasonable if you pulled off something amazing and the rest of the group didn't seem to notice.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These elections need to fit into one of these three categories:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STRENGTH</strong> This character demonstrated strength based on how their character’s culture defines strength, which could be physical prowess but could also be cunning or grifting.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MASTERY</strong> This is given when a character solves a tricky problem or came up with a creative solution. Note, this shouldn't be given for good rolls unless the players want to lose Honor for bad rolls; this is about out of the box thinking.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">COURAGE</strong> When the chips were down, did your character give up the fight or did they really show what it means to be a hero and stare down death?</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ROLEPLAYING</strong> Did the player really role play his character? Where his decisions about what he thought gave him the best chance to win or was it about what his character thought would be a good idea? Note, that since players are electing each other, jackasses who use “that’s just what my character would do” to dick over the party won’t get rewarded for this much. This should be specifically linked to a character's Confrontation Characteristics.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GAINING HONOR DICE</strong> Whenever you go up an Honor Category, you gain a free use of your Honor Dice. Also, when you reach 25 Honor, you get one as well, even though you didn't technically go up a category. Once used, they go away but they stay with your character as long as they live. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Certain Archetype abilities may also give you them temporarily, in which case, the Archetype will note for how long you have them. </p><p style="margin:0px;">For each of these categories, the GM can also dock Honor from a character. Did they run away, or did they conveniently forget any Characteristics that would have screwed them over?</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">That and spending Honor are the two main ways of losing Honor.</p><h1>Skills</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Skills are used as a way to determine the success or failure of a given action, based on what your character knows about the given subject or about how to perform the given task. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You don’t have to use these rules all the time, i.e., you don’t have to roll to see if your character successfully walks across a room, but at times they’re a good way to semi-randomly determine the outcome of a tricky task, i.e., walking across a room full of traps. </p><h2>Skill Introduction</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> There are two types of skills that you’re going to be pulling from: Skill Suites and Advanced Skills.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Skill Suites represent broad swathes of knowledge that cover a variety of subjects. Suites are hard to increase because there’s so much ground to cover but can be used if you don’t have the specific Advanced Skill. An example of this is the Survival and Lore Skill Suites.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Advanced Skills are more tightly focused, covering one intellectual discipline. They’re easier to master but may not be applicable in every case. An example of this would be the First Aid, Fire Building, and Foraging skills in the Survival Skill Suite and the Law, History, and Medicine skills in the Lore Skill Suite.</p><h4>ACQUIRING SKILLS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Throughout your character’s career, she’ll acquire and improve her skills. Both types of skills are purchased with CrP, that is spent either at Character Creation or on leveling up. All skills have a unique cost that represents how easy or difficult they are to master. You pay the price as noted in the section below, you improve the skill.</p><h4>CALCULATING RANK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SKILL SUITES </strong>For all your Skill Suites, your starting Rank is 0, unless noted in the following example:</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ADVANCED SKILLS </strong> Your starting Rank for Advanced Skills is the Rank for the mother Skill Suite.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PURCHASING A SKILL </strong>Advanced Skills cost their Base Cost + (Current Rank * 2), while Skill Suites cost their Base Cost Base Cost + (Current Rank * 5). If you have Skill Adept, both have a minimum of 1.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Every purchase increases your Rank in that Skill by 1. Purchases of Skill Suites also raises the Rank of any child Advanced Skills you’ve already purchased, so that’s nice.</p><h4>SKILL SPECIALIZATIONS</h4><p style="margin:0px;">It often pays to specialize. After all, many dissertations cover extremely minute subjects with incredible depth and drawing on that well of knowledge can be a huge benefit.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Skill Specializations represent an area of knowledge within an Advanced Skill that your character spends extra time versing themselves in. As such, they gain a bonus.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Skill specializations come in layers, modifiers that narrow down the field. Each layer gives a +1 to your effective Rank when it comes into play.</p><p style="margin:0px;">There may come a time when a specialization only kind of applies. In this case, it may be kind of helpful, as the max bonus that can be gained from it is +1.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, when encountering a land predator in the Uchka Mountains, all three monster hunters would only gain +1 to their Rank.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">That sort of super-focused study takes a lot of time and effort and man only has so much time and energy to give. The total number of specializations per Advanced Skill that a character can have is equal to half his Intelligence score.</p><p style="margin:0px;">A character can gain a specialization like any other skill; having his character go out of the way to learn more about his craft. The price is the base cost of the Advanced Skill times the number of layers in the specialization plus one.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A character can go back and increase the number of layers in his Skill Specialization after his initial purchase of it, but it costs additional amount of CrPs equal to twice the base cost of the Advanced Skill.</p><h2>The Basics (Skill Checks)</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Before we go off talking about Skill Challenges, time, equipment, and all those other things, it’s first important to understand the very basic mechanic all of those things will hang off of: Skill Checks.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Skill Checks are any checks made that move the Skill Challenge along and/or determine a success or failure. </p><p style="margin:0px;">At their very basic, Skill Checks have both sides rolling a d20!, adding any applicable Skill’s Rank, the Skill Modifier based on the Skill’s relevant stat, and any modifiers for difficulty. The person with the highest total wins and you successfully bypass or eliminate the Obstacle, depending on the situation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If a Skill has more than one relevant stat, use the lowest modifier. A space on your character sheet has been provided to record this to make referencing during play quicker.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">It is assumed that your character is trying their hardest to be successful in whatever they attempt and so any Check you make inflicts d4! Stress if they don't succeed by more than 5.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Answering a Question</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Another use of a single use Skill Check is answering a question that you don’t know the answer to like “out of these two walls, which looks easier to climb?” Things that would be reasonable for them to be there, but you don’t know because you didn’t prepare for that question.</p></td></tr></table><h2>Skill Challenges</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Skill Checks refer to a single roll against a single Skill, while a Skill Challenge refers to a host of Skill Checks. To use a metaphor: a Skill Challenge would be breaking into the castle. The Skill Checks would be climbing the walls, hiding in the shadows, sneaking past the guards, listening at doors, lockpicking any locks, etc.</p><h4>OBJECTIVES AND OBSTACLES</h4><p style="margin:0px;">A Skill Challenge doesn’t exist without something that your character wants and at least one thing that stands in their way.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This could be something straightforward: I want to get out of this jail cell, but a locked door is in my way, or it could be something more complicated like I want to capture this outlaw but he’s several days’ ride ahead of me.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These are your Objective and Obstacles, respectively.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Achieving your Objective is a matter of beating or getting past all the Obstacles in your way.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Obstacles are beaten through successfully rolling Skill Checks, which will be discussed more in the next section. Note that an Obstacle can continue to be a factor that needs to be considered, for example, a guard patrol, or it can be something that only needs to be taken care of once, for example, unlocking a door.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Obstacles also have Failure Threshold, which represents badly you have to fail against them to actually fail. More on this in the Complications, Boons, & Hard Failures section below.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>The Single Check</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Before we dive in, I think it's worth saying that there may be times when you have something that might call for a Skill Check but not a Skill Challenge. Most often you'll do this when there is danger but not a huge time crunch, like, for instance, players leaping over a cliff or when there’s a chance of failure, like the player not knowing a monster weakness.</p><p style="margin:0px;">In that case, it would be perfectly reasonable to just call for a single Jumping (or Monster Craft) Check. If the players want to do some Preparation or use any of the other tools at their disposal, they can.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Or, if there is a time crunch but it is so narrow players really wouldn't have the time to prepare, like having to jump the chasm while a horde of brigands with bows are closing it, you might also just default to the single roll: no need to break out these rules in that case.</p><p style="margin:0px;">In these cases, the Failure Threshold of the Check would be 1, meaning a failure is a failure, but you can spice it up by having the jump almost make it but now the player is just barely hanging out: however, much time you want to spend on it.</p></td></tr></table><h4>DIFFICULTY</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Difficulty is a dice that is added to the Skill Check based on things that might be going on at the time to either help or hinder your success. This difficulty is noted just as a single dice (+d6!, for example) but you'll add a d20! to it by default.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Obstacles can have static, variable, shrinking, circular, growing, or universal difficulties. They can also be linked together.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STATIC </strong>means that the dice pretty much stays the same, outside of player interaction. This is often used for one off checks and not really used as the main part of a Skill Challenge because, let’s face it, doing the same Check over and over again isn’t that interesting.</p><p style="margin:0px;">What you'll mainly see is Static Difficulties linked together in an Obstacle. So, for instance, a rock wall that is slippery at the base, then has a section with a lot of handholds, and finishes with an overhang, would be three separate Checks, the first with a d12! difficulty for the wall, the next with a d4! for the players, and the final with a d10!, again for the wall.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SHRINKING </strong>means that it starts high but then the dice shrinks as time passes, often becoming static at a certain point. This is when the threat becomes less and less severe, and I would use this sparingly and with other types of Obstacles, but it can represent the fact that leaving a place is often easier than getting in.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GROWING </strong>is the opposite of shrinking: it starts low and then increases as time passes, again, sometimes becoming static at a certain point. This is used to represent threats that continue to grow, often times when there is time pressure.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">UNIVERSAL </strong>This is a term for an Obstacle that will go off at sometime but won't be directly faced by the players. It represents a chance encounter, such as running into someone randomly, or a stroke of bad luck, like bad weather. Unlike other Obstacles, players won't make Checks directly against it but any Failure (or Success) against another Obstacle in that Challenge adds a like amount of Failure (or Success) to any Universal Obstacles.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This can also be used for timed Challenges, such as a chance or encroaching deadline. In that case you not only count both Boons and Failures, as they represent time passing, but also questions your players ask count as 1 Complication, representing them taking time to get stock of their surroundings, which you oftentimes don’t have as much time to do under pressure.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CIRCULAR </strong>means it starts at a difficulty, grows to a certain difficulty, and then shrinks down to its original difficulty, rinse and repeat, ad nauseam. It can also start shrinking, if you’d like. This is often used as patrols, like guards and such, but also a monster stalking an area would be represented by this type of Obstacle though you would have it be a bit more random to represent that unpredictability.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LINKED </strong>Obstacles are Obstacles that whose outcomes affect one another. So, for instance, if the players are in a wagon chase down a rocky road, with one player at the helm, stirring, and the others in the back firing crossbows, how well the player of the reigns does affect the attack rolls of those in the back. In this case, add or subtract the number of Complications or Boons to the Check of any linked Obstacles.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that Linked Obstacles will also be paired with another Difficulty type.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Multi-Layer Checks</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Let's say that you're trying to deduce facts about bears before you go to fight one. The thing is, there is a lot to know about bears and your character probably isn't going to know all of it, so making a single Check is too binary while making multiple Checks is too tedious. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In steps the Multi-Layer Check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In this case, the GM would assign Difficulty Dice to the different facts about bears based on how esoteric the knowledge is. He would then roll 1 d20! and all of those Difficulty Dice. You would only roll a single Check and the compare that to the difference totals to see if you recall those facts. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>"Pausing" the Skill Challenge</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">The players don’t always have to be making Skill Checks during a Skill Challenge - they should only do so when it makes sense.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, (using the above example) if the patrols aren’t very good and the guards get too far away from the players to reasonably hear them, no Check should be required.</p><p style="margin:0px;">But that doesn’t mean that time stops: if the players wait long enough, the guards will return, and Checks will need to start up again.</p></td></tr></table><h4>COMPLICATIONS, BOONS, & HARD FAILURES</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Failing a Check doesn’t automatically mean that you’re instantly screwed: Failing a single Move Silently Check doesn’t result in the guards catching you. In Bonfire, there are Complications and hard failures.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Every Obstacle will have a number of Complications it can gain before it hard fails. This is called its Failure Threshold. You gain Complications by failing Skill Checks: every 5 points below what you needed to get gives the Obstacle 1 Complication, rounded up (so a failure by 1 - 5 is still considered a Complication).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Complications represent complications, such as the guard hearing something, or you leaving a clue behind that might give someone a heads up that you're there. An Obstacle gets +2 for every Complication is has on it. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When an Obstacle gets more Complications than its Failure Threshold, it hard fails. Hard failures are when something bad actually happens. In this case, it does result in you getting caught by the guards, or it results in your falling off the wall and taking damage. Even after a hard failure, you can sometimes try again, like in the case of falling off the wall.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Failure doesn’t diminish during the Skill Challenge, but it does reset for a new one.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BOONS</strong> are the opposite of Complications: they give you a small benefit or boost for accomplishing a test extra well. You get 1 Boon for every 5 full points above what you needed.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Complication in the Narrative</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Complications don’t mean that the Skill Challenge grinds to a halt while the players keep reattempting that Skill: instead, it should represent the players coming closer to danger.</p><h2>Strategies</h2><h4>ASSETS</h4><p style="margin:0px;">These represent static pools of knowledge or information that you can pull from if you have time. So, for instance, a book on the subject, or a library are examples of an Asset but also an old friend who used to be a ranger and who could give you a few pointers could also be considered one.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Anything you can think of that might apply might be an Asset you can draw on.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Assets have two stats: their <strong style="color:#B45F06;">KNOWLEDGE</strong> and their <strong style="color:#B45F06;">ORGANIZATION</strong>. Basically, how much they know and how easy that knowledge is to get.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Each of these is given a qualifier of either <strong style="color:#B45F06;">POOR</strong>, <strong style="color:#B45F06;">AVERAGE</strong>, or <strong style="color:#B45F06;">GOOD</strong>.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For Knowledge, Poor represents a +3, Average +6, and Good +9 while for Organization Poor is Days, Average is Hours, and Good is Minutes.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Spending 1 unit of an Asset’s Organization gives you +1 bonus up to their Knowledge. So, if you’re searching through a poorly taken care of but extensive library (Knowledge: Good, Organization: Poor), spending 5 days there gives you a +5, while spending two weeks there only gives you a +9.</p><p style="margin:0px;">That bonus can then be redeemed on a Skill Check later on. Although it can only be redeemed once, it does apply to any rerolls made against the same Obstacle.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You don’t automatically know the Rank or the Time Investment of an Asset. This can also be applied to Weapon, Armor, and Shield Trainings through manuals and sparring.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Another benefit of Assets is that it is often multifaceted and can be used to get different bonuses. That old ranger friend can help you with navigation but also probably knows a thing or two about botany.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Assets can also be increased and expanded upon as well, increasing its qualifiers. A good relationship with a contact might give you information quicker, donating to the local library may increase its selection, or hiring excavators to dig up a ruin may unearth more artifacts that help you decipher that ancient script.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There may be some special cases where an Asset will take care of itself, but you may have to check back on it, such as Snaring in the forest. You set your trap and then a day or two later, you can go back and check it to see if you caught anything - in the meantime, you can get other work done.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">REDEEMING CONTACTS</strong> Characters get a number of starting contacts based on their Charisma, with the expectation they'll gain more as they adventure, but these starting contacts can prove useful as they can be redeemed at any time and defined on the spot.</p><p style="margin:0px;">After that, of course, contacts can be used time and time again: they're part of the world.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">How a contact helps is largely determined by the circumstances of why they were redeemed but the GM should, for the most part, consider them Assets starting with Poor Knowledge and Organization. A player can increase that when they redeem a contact by sacrificing additional contacts, raising one of their stats on a one-for-one basis. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ROLEPLAYING OUT A SCENE VS USING ASSETS</strong> Assets are not meant to replace specific roleplaying areas where you need specific pieces of information: they’re meant to reward players for remembering to do otherwise boring and mundane things that might still help their character. You can also combine the two.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Using Other Players as Assets</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">I think it's completely reasonable that players would want to use each other's characters as Assets and why shouldn't they? So, in this case the player’s Knowledge is instead based around the Rank they have in the applicable Skill with their Organization being based on their Characteristics.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If they have 3 or fewer Characteristics related to teaching or communication, they’re considered Poor; 4 to 6 they’re considered Average; greater than 6, Good.</p><p style="margin:0px;">GMs should also feel free to reward players who sit there and talk things out and plan by awarding the Asset bonus as well, even if they don't spend a full hour+ planning.</p></td></tr></table><h4>EQUIPMENT</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Your kit can really pull you through in a pinch and these are catchall rules for the use of equipment that doesn’t already come with auxiliary benefits, such as weapons (damage) and armor (DR).</p><p style="margin:0px;">Players are assumed to be using all equipment that would help them with a Check if they have time so they shouldn’t feel the need to go through their list of climbing gear every time they scale a wall, although, if time is short and they need to rush, that may be appropriate.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">On a Skill Check, the first piece of equipment you use gives you a free reroll, taking the higher of the two results. After that, each additional piece gives you a +1, although if this additional gear has Traits that apply, you can use that instead of the +1. More on equipment Traits is found in the Deluxe version of <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/10"]' [queryParams]='{ search : "11jJtZtvYlDt"}'>Chapter 10: Equipment</a>. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Redeeming this bonus causes the tool degrades, giving it (and any other equipment you use) 1 Wear, whether you succeed or not. More on Wear can be found in <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/10"]' [queryParams]='{ search : "wearheading"}'>Chapter 10: Equipment</a>. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Assets & Equipment Based Skills</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Some skills are only going to be useful if you have the proper equipment or the right Asset. For instance, if you’re not out in the wilderness, you can’t really use Snaring or if you don’t have the proper tools or a woodshop, Maintenance won’t do you any good. In cases, being able to make the Check in the first place is considered an auxiliary benefit and so this bonus doesn't apply. This will need to be handled on a case to case basis.</p></td></tr></table><h4>HELPER SKILLS</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Let’s say that you’re tracking someone in the wilderness. You have Hunting at Rank 4 and Endurance at Rank 3. Seems like being able to move quickly over a longer period of time, should help you catch the guys, and it does.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you have another Advanced Skill that you think might help you, you can add it as a bonus, however doing so costs you d4! Stress for every Skill you apply. This can't be reduced by Not Sweating It.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This may seem like it is nearly identical to Preparation, and they are very close. The difference is that Preparation is a general thing that applies to a Skill Check you’re going to make in the future, while using a helper Skill is in the moment and is specific to the scenario. You can use both at the same time, since the help Skill gives a bonus and Preparation gives a reroll.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Skill Mobbing</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">For GMs, note that Helper Skills are how you handle Skill Mobbing, where everyone just overpowers a roll by all rolling against it. Instead, only one person rolls and only those with an applicable Advanced Skill and willing to take that Stress add their Rank to help out. </p></td></tr></table><h4>MULTI-TASKING</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Let’s be realistic here: you’re probably going to end up trying to do two things at once, like climbing a wall and doing so quietly.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If that’s the case, you’re going to have to “split” your d20! into smaller dice and assign those to each of the Checks you’re trying to make, because your attention is divided. The total max value of the dice can never exceed 20 but it can be lower than it. The other side will still be rolling full d20!s against you.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, if you’re climbing a wall and trying to do so quietly, you’d have to make a Climbing and a Move Silently Check. You could split it like so: d12! for Climbing and d8! for Move Silently, or d10! for Climbing and d10! for Move Silently, or d12!+d4! for Move Silently and d4! for Climbing.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Or you could just say “screw being quiet” and roll a d20! for Climbing and take a 0 for Move Silently. In this case, the GM would just roll against your Skill Rank. So, if you choose to ignore Move Silently but have a Rank 4 in it, the GM would roll their dice, and you can hope they don’t roll higher than 4.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Either way, besides this, it works like a normal Check, except that, for the Stress gain, you're going to roll 1d4! for each Skill they're attempting but only use the highest if applicable. They need to succeed all Checks by 5 to completely remove the Stress gain. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Not Paying Attention</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Multi-Tasking is also used when someone isn't paying attention, such as a guard who's on watch but he's been there for several hours at this point so he's not doing it so closely. In this case, start at a d10!, lowering it further as needs be. </p></td></tr></table><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Helping Others</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">It feels good to help people and Bonfire is all about group cooperation. The fighter helps the skill monkey survive combat and the skill monkey helps the fighter not look like an idiot while doing detective work.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">And how you help other characters will really depend on the situation. Perhaps your Preparation can be used to help another person hide or perhaps you have a bit of knowledge that they don’t.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Really, this will be done to what feels right in the moment, but this note is here to draw attention to someone helping you as an Asset and someone adding their Rank to yours with a Helper Skill, and how they’re different. </p><p style="margin:0px;">And the difference is time. If you have plenty of time to coach someone while they’re climbing a cliff face, you’d be an Asset and you wouldn't take Stress.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But if you’re being chased by the guards and it’s a matter of seconds or minutes, you’d add a Helper Skill and you would need to take the Stress.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Note that if the skill monkey is also trying to climb the cliff face and coach as they go, that would be considered a d10! worth of effort for Multi-Tasking, though you don’t have to actually roll to see if you help. </p></td></tr></table><h4>NOT SWEATING IT</h4><p style="margin:0px;">While the default is to assume that characters actually care about the outcome of the Check, that's not always the case since not everything is equally important. In the cases of lesser importance, the character can simply not sweat it. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In this case, they take no Stress from the Check but take a -4 penalty.</p><h4>PREPARATION</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Preparation is anything your character does to help a specific Skill Check that will be made in the future (even if that future is 2 seconds from now). Note that this doesn't have to be a Check you make: it can also apply to an ally's Check (if it makes sense).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Usually, these only take a couple of seconds but can vary widely depending on the circumstances. Throwing a rock is a matter of moments while constructing a gilly suit will take a lot longer.</p><p style="margin:0px;">As long as there is time, there is no chance of failure or, if the players have plenty of time, Preparation just happens. Mark what you did for later in the Skill Challenge.</p><p style="margin:0px;">However, if there is a time crunch or a chance of failure, Preparation works like a normal Skill Check with success means the preparation is actually useful.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Either way, you only get one Prep Check per Advanced Skill that applies for each upcoming Check, unless you have Assets but remember that they do take time.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">That means that if you know you're going to have to make a jump, you can use Acrobatics to stretch, Endurance to do a few practice sprints to the edge, and Sports (long jumping) to remember techniques all to prep for the same Jump check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When you redeem Preparation that you’ve readied, you can reroll Obstacle's d20, taking the worse of the two results.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Planning & Action Phases</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">While it isn’t entirely black and white, it’s helpful to think of Challenges as composing two phases: planning and action; the laying out the plan and then the heist.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Planning is gathering intel, getting your team and equipment together, and planning your route of attack. This is where you’ll use Preparation and Assets mostly.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Action phase is when you’ll be doing a lot of the Checks and Stress, as well as equipment and companions - using what you learned in the Prep Phase to help you get through the sticky parts.</p><p style="margin:0px;">But don’t get too hung up on separating these ideas though. Even during the heist, you might find it worth your time to sit on your heels and take your time while doing some Preparation as there will almost certainly be problems that crop up that you need to adjust to.</p></td></tr></table><h4>RUSHING IT</h4><p style="margin:0px;">If you’re in a hurry to get the job down, you can just rush it. This lowers the time a Check actually makes but gives you a -5.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The bonus for this is that Complications you would get from the Check don't get added to Universal or Linked Obstacles in the Challenge, though Hard Failures do add 2 Complications to them. </p><h2>Skill Descriptions</h2><table style="border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px;width:325px"><tr

ability to stretch their body, do flips, and turn cartwheels. This allows the character to vault fences without slowing down or roll to avoid falling damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Reference the Check to Not Slow Down table to calculate the base Difficulty to, well, not slow down when you encounter an obstacle.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">To reduce falling damage, remove 10 ft from the effective fall distance for every Boon you get.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CLIMBING </strong>This Skill covers climbing and repelling up and down walls of various heights and textures.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Difficulty should be based on height, with about every 40 ft increasing the Difficulty by 1 dice size. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Textures should also play a major factor in not just how tough the Check is but also how many Checks need to be made for a given wall.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if there’s a wall, where the base is stone at a 45% slant for 20 ft, then it moves to close knit stones for another 40 ft, and then finally to a wood overhang for just 5 ft, and then to a wooden wall for 10 ft, there would be 4 Climbing Checks in this order: +d4!, +d10! (d8! for base but because it’s 40 ft, it gets bumped up 1), d10!, and +0.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ENDURANCE </strong>Through training, a character can push his body past the limits of his base physical ability. The Rank of this Skill serves as DR against the damage you take while Running or Sprinting, although specifics are given in the Actions section of Chapter: 9 Combat.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ESCAPE ARTIST </strong>This allows the character to escape bonds and restrictions and is always rolled opposed, either against the Rope Use Skill of the person who tied them or against the quality of the manacles or binds the person was put in. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The character can make a straight +0 Check, not to break the bounds or get free, but to instead move his body to an advantageous position.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">JUMPING </strong>When you need to cover a distance without touching the ground, jump.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Typically, a character can jump 16 inches vertically or 5 ft horizontally without a Check, however, if they wish to go further, they’ll need to roll.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Each Boon adds 2 inches to the vertical jump and 6 inches to the horizontally. Starting at a run doubles this.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Small creatures half these numbers while Large creatures double them.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SPORT (SPECIFIC) </strong>This covers the actual playing of a specific sport as well as an in-depth knowledge of the game’s rules as well as famous players and techniques.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If it becomes a plot point, the GM should feel free to make this Skill apply to only certain positions, like pitching or shortstop but this a fantasy roleplaying game so I doubt that’ll happen.</p><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Move Silently Speed </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Dice to Roll on</td><td>Speed</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>d20!</td><td>Crawling/Strolling</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>d12!</td><td>Walking</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>d8!</td><td>Jog</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>d4!</td><td>Run</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>0</td><td>Sprint</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MOVE SILENTLY </strong>When you want to move silently, you’ll want to use this Skill. This involves being able to feel your way along and compensate for creaks.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This is always an opposed Check vs any potential listener’s Listening, with a failure indicating that the listener has heard something suspicious, though the person attempting Move Silently may not be aware that they were detected.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Moving at speeds greater than a Crawl or Strolling speed is considered Multitasking. Refer to the following table for what to roll.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SWIMMING </strong>This Skill allows a character to not drown in water.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Difficulty of the Check is determined by the water (or other liquid, I don’t judge) you’re attempting to swim in, though simply trying to float on your back and letting the current take you gives you a +d8! to your roll, though it is risky because you could get pulled into an aquifer or get pulled over a waterfall but that’s the chance you take.</p><h4>LORE SKILL SUITE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This suite covers general knowledge, which is mostly academic in nature. Most of it is pretty heavy stuff but the basics are second nature or stuff that’s been picked up here and there.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ADMINISTRATION </strong>While they’ll never inspire the awe or respect that other leaders do, people who oversee the day to day functions of an organization keep the lights on so that others can make the speeches.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Administrators can make a Check at +0 to gain a clue about an item the party might need on their adventure, or one to retroactively remember that they did buy an item back at the market for just such an occasion.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Each of these Checks they make increases the Difficulty of the next one by 1 step.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HISTORY </strong>Everyone knows certain large events, but few can tie those events into an overarching narrative and understand their effects on later events.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The History Skill allows a character to not just recall events but also to link them to the present day, to certain traditions and rituals of a culture, or the behavior of certain members of a culture, giving insight on how to proceed.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LANGUAGE (SPECIFIC) </strong>A character receives this Skill for free in their native tongue with a Rank equal to their Int and it allows them to speak and be understood by others with Skill in that language.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Checks are only made when timing is critical, such as communication in a battle, or when understanding is key, such as when debating foreign policy.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If one of the characters is in a Confrontation with another in a tongue that’s not their native one, that person can only bring in as many dice per round as he has Ranks in that Language.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Additionally, when two native speakers are in a Confrontation, the one with the higher Language Rank gains an additional dice (see Applicable Skills in Chapter 8: Confrontation ). In case of tie, nothing happens.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Lore Skill Suite can’t be used in place of a Language Check for tongues you don’t know unless you have the Language Skill in a related Language. Using a real-world example, someone with the Language (Swedish) Advanced Skill couldn’t use the Lore Skill Suite to understand a person with Language (French) but could use it when talking to someone with Language (Norwegian) or Language (Danish).</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LAW (CULTURE) </strong>This Skill covers the intricacies of the legal system, including landmark rulings and common punishments for common crimes. A character can make their case or find loopholes to exploit the legal system.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A character’s Lore Skill can only be used to substitute for their native culture but not others’. If the character does wish to branch out, his mastery of Law for that new culture starts at 0, as he must learn everything from the ground up. Diving more into his own culture’s laws (buying this Advanced Skill for his culture) uses the Lore Skill as base, as per usual.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LITERACY (ALPHABET) </strong>This Skill allows a character to read and write in a language’s alphabet, giving them the power to pen books and poems, or passive aggressive notes. A character who's taken the Lore Skill Suite is considered to be literate in their native language's alphabet.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This Skill can be taken multiple times, each instance representing mastery of a new writing system. The scribe can then use that alphabet to pen any language they know, in the same way that we could use the Latin Alphabet to pen Arabic or the Korean Alphabet to write English.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">To decipher a text, the person needs to know both the alphabet it's written in and the language it's using, which most of the time won't matter but can be used as a cheap way to do a cypher in a pinch.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MATHEMATICS </strong>While this may seem like just a Skill that allows you to be able to juggle figures and add totals and calculate the area of a circle like a huge nerd, mathematics has a more practical use: correctly guessing distances.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While you can try to eyeball how far away something is, a Mathematics Check vs +0 allows you to do rough calculations, giving you the ability to know exactly what penalty you’re going to get for using a ranged weapon or who's going to be affected by the Area of Effect of a spell you’re going to cast.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MEDICINE </strong>With proper treatment and nursing, a wound that would lay you out for weeks, may only keep you down for a couple of days. This Skill involves the knowledge of long-term care, when bandages should be changed, which poultices will have the greatest effect, and what minor surgeries need to be performed.</p><p style="margin:0px;">A character with this Skill can make a Check for a wounded person, adding the Severity of his largest Wound to the opposing roll.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, if a person has a 5, 3, and 8 Severity Wound, he can make a Medicine Check vs d20+8. </p><p style="margin:0px;">Success means that the person can take 1 day off the healing time for every Wound every time it drops a Severity. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, a success against a 5 Severity Wound means that it was treated properly and takes 10 days to completely heal ( 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 ) instead of the normal 15.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You may also increase the Difficulty modifier by half again as much - if you succeed, you take 2 days off per Severity. So, if you're against a d20!+9, you can make it a d20!+14 ( 9 + ( 9 / 2 ) ) for that bonus.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Additionally, when resisting Poison, Toxin, or Diseases, you can add your Medicine Rank, rounded up, to each round of the Confrontation.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MONSTER CRAFT </strong>This Advanced Skill is under both the Lore and Survival Skill Suite but still counts as 1 Skill, so you don’t have to buy it twice - they share their Rank. It simply represents the different ways that each Skill Suite approaches the craft.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Monster Craft gives you insight into the creatures that roam the Middle Realm. Simply put, each Boon gives you a (truthful) answer to a question.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Difficulty is based on how common the monster is. Common is +0, uncommon +d6!, rare is d12!, and legendary is +d20!.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RELIGION (CULT) </strong>This Skill acquaints the character with a knowledge of cults, their common Covenants and Miracles, as well as their hierarchies, means of advancement, and important members.</p><p style="margin:0px;">It also allows a character to gain a knowledge of their rituals and sacrifices, as well as the taboos of their clergy and how to appease their heavenly messengers and avenging angels.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The Religion Skill is taken for a single Covenant, but can be purchased independently for different Covenants. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A character adds the tens digit of this Skill to their chance of gaining Favor when making sacrifices to the god of that cult.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">WORLD CRAFT </strong>This area of study covers the topography of the Middle Realm. It’s forests and rock formations and biomes. It helps predict whether or not it’s going to rain or whether the next summer is going to be a hot one.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Predicting what’s coming in the next hour is a Check vs +0, with the Difficulty increasing by 1 dice size for each time you double the prediction window. So, detecting the weather in the next 2 hours is vs +d4!, while doing so in the next 16 hours is vs +d10!.</p><h4>STREETWISE SKILL SUITE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This suite covers knowledge that a character might pick on the street or in the school of hard knocks. While Lore is book smart, Streetwise is street smart.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CURRENT AFFAIRS </strong>A character with this Skill is well informed about the day to day affairs of regional powers and men and women of importance, their dealings and alliances, as well as their hatreds. He can pick out celebrities and know how and why someone got rich and famous. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">They can also use this Skill to guess the Honor category of someone by watching how people react to them and letting them know about certain NPCs' Reputations.</p><table style="width:225px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Deception Check </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Difficulty</td><td>Level of Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+0</td><td>White Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>+d4!</td><td>Lie of Omission</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+d6!</td><td>Mostly True Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>+d8!</td><td>Half Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+d10!</td><td>Mostly False Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>+d12!</td><td>Absolute Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+d20!</td><td>Absolute Lie with Easy Evidence Against It</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DECEPTION </strong>This covers all sorts of deception, where you want the person to believe the opposite of the truth, or, to put it simply, when you want to lie to them.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The level of Difficulty to pull off a lie is based on how much of what you’re saying isn’t the truth, strictly speaking. This is always opposed by either the other character’s Deception or Perception but only if the character has reason to suspect that you’re lying to them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Even if you succeed, this isn’t a permanent way of changing their mind. New evidence presented to that person may cause them to rethink their opinion on what you tried to sell them so be careful about what falsehoods you spin. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FORGERY </strong>Mostly commonly used for creating fake currency, forgery is a Skill that allows a character to reproduce something effectively and fool others. This Skill acquaints the character with common forging techniques and knowledge with what possible agents will be looking for.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The forger must also have the appropriate corresponding Craft or Trade Skill, so he can’t forge coins if he doesn’t have the Metalworking Skill, though that’s within reason: a character forging an official passport with one at hand doesn’t need to have Literacy as he can just copy the letters, though he may also need to have Artistry (wood cutting) to create the heraldry on it, but someone trying to forge an official declaration from scratch does need to have the Literacy Skill in that language plus Artistry (wood cutting).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Forgery is opposed by Perception, the applicable Skill, or Forgery but only if the character looking has reason to suspect there’s something else. A lazy guard probably won’t Check your passport too closely right before lunch, but a particularly astute one who's on the lookout for a promotion will.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GAMBLING/GAMING </strong>This Skill doesn’t give the character a gift for winning games, just that he knows the rules and knows the odds, which could in turn lead to him winning the game.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INTUITION </strong>The ability to understand people and get where they're coming from can help you figure out what will and won't work with them better. </p><p style="margin:0px;">A Check vs +0 allows the character to get a feel for how open a person would be to a Confrontation over something or what would be definite deal breakers for them. It doesn't reveal any of their Characteristics or their strengths as it's more of gut feeling than anything.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Each Check on the same person increases the Difficulty by 1 dice size. </p><p style="margin:0px;">They can also use it to confirm their theories about what Characteristics a character has. The player needs to make a reasonable guess about the Characteristic first - so players who’re simply throwing out guesses automatically fail. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This is done at a Check vs +0 to start with but increases by 1 for every dice size per guess, whether the character succeeded at the last ones or not.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LISTENING </strong>While Perception handles the other senses, Listening has to deal with your character’s auditory senses. This goes beyond simply hearing something: listening allows the character to know when an otherwise innocuous noise is actually something to pay attention to though it might not always be apparent why at first. </p><table style="width:300px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="3" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Lock Picking </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Lock Difficulty</td><td>Base Time</td><td>Time Off</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+0</td><td>1 Minute</td><td>5 Seconds</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>+d4!</td><td>5 Minutes</td><td>30 Seconds</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+d6!</td><td>20 Minutes</td><td>2 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>+d8!</td><td>30 Minutes</td><td>3 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+d10!</td><td>45 Minutes</td><td>5 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>+d12!</td><td>1 Hour</td><td>10 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+1 Dice Size</td><td>Add. +15 Minutes</td><td>+5 Minutes</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LOCK PICKING </strong>It takes a lot more know-how than you might think to pick a lock. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The amount of time it takes to pick any lock is based on your Skill level and the quality of the lock. Subtract the Time Off * their Boons from the Base Time.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PERCEPTION </strong>This covers four of the five senses that a character has: sight, touch, taste, and smell. Technically, your character is always receiving inputs from these senses, but Perception helps filter out the unimportant ones. Can he detect if there are orcs in the nearby bush? Can she taste the hidden poison in her drink before she swallows? These are all Perception Checks</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Like Listening, sometimes Perception will help the character notice something that may be important, even if it’s not obvious why it’s grabbing your attention.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SLEIGHT OF HAND </strong>This Skill covers all things that require you to do quick, delicate movements with your fingers. This may be slipping a card up your sleeve, picking a pocket, or doing cat’s cradle while bored.</p><h4>SURVIVAL SKILL SUITE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This suite covers everything that a character might need to survive in the wild; Knowledge of what plants to eat and the Skills to hunt and breed animals.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BOTANY </strong>This gives a knowledge of what the herbs used in cooking, alchemy, and medicine look like in their natural environment and it allows you to identify their common uses. It also helps find food in the wilderness.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If halving their overland travel speed, a person with Botany can make a Check every travel period: if they succeed, they can consider themselves 1 step up on the Long-Term Exhaustion table. So, if they had nothing, they could consider themselves Rationing.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If they choose to stay put, a success nets them 2 steps up.</p><p style="margin:0px;">4 or more Boons results in doubling their output, meaning they possibly found themselves enough food for the next day.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Mostly, this is used for detecting poisonous plants, which is Check vs +d4! but is a common Helper Skill for both Medicine and Cooking/Baking.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FIRE BUILDING </strong>Against the cold, lonely nights out in the wild, there is only the fertility symbols you carve for yourself and the roar of the fire. This Skill allows you to build one of those things: the fire.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Under normal conditions, it takes about 30 minutes and a Check vs +0 to set up and light a fire, assuming you don’t have to go far out of your way to find the wood.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FIRST AID </strong>This gives the character a crude understanding of battlefield medicine: making splints and staunching wounds.</p><p style="margin:0px;">A character with this Skill can make a Check for a person wounded in that last 30 minutes, adding the Severity of any Wounds that he's treating to the opposing roll. </p><p style="margin:0px;">So, if a person has a 5, 3, and 8 Severity Wound, he can make a First Aid Check vs d20+16 or he can choose not to treat the 8 Severity Wound and make a vs d20!+8. Success means that the person can take 1 level of Severity off those Wounds. So, a 5 Severity Wound drops immediately to a 4 Severity Wound. You cannot go back and do a Check for a Wound that you skipped.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You have 30 minutes to perform First Aid Checks for a person, with each Wound taking 3 minutes, if applicable. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You may also increase the Difficulty modifier by half again as much - if you succeed, you hit 2 points of damage. So, if you're against a d20!+9, you can make it a d20!+14 ( 9 + ( 9 / 2 ) ) to heal 2 points of damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HANDLE ANIMAL (SPECIFIC) </strong>This Skill deals with the handling and care of a specific animal, from birth to the slaughterhouse. It also deals with training and common illnesses to make sure the stock is healthy and virile.</p><p style="margin:0px;">While most Checks are handled like normal knowledge Checks or on a case-by-case basis (such as calming down your animal during a storm), using a question-and-answer style, this Skill is also used for training, with the base number of tricks you can teach an animal equal to their Int (note that carrying things and handling a bridle are two different tricks). </p><p style="margin:0px;">The animal needs to have both the basic temperament and physical ability to learn a trick (no sheep becoming pack animals and no dogs learning to pick locks). The GM may increase or decrease this for particularly smart/dumb and obedient/obstinate animals.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">After a month of training, a roll is made vs +0. If successfully, the animal learned the trick. If not, another Check can be made in a month, although every failure increases the Difficulty to learn that trick by 1 dice size.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The base price of this Skill is calculated towards domesticated animals. If the player wishes to learn how to deal with wild animals, this Skill costs thrice as much to purchase.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HIDING </strong>This allows a character to make the most of a situation or environment to cloak themselves against prying eyes. This is always opposed by Perception, with the Difficulty determined by the area. Characters can also use this to instantly get an idea of how well they can hide in the given space.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MONSTER CRAFT </strong>This Skill is the same as the Monster Craft under the Lore Skill Suite. Look there for details on it.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">NAVIGATION </strong>Either using the stars or the position of the moons and sun, this character can track their way even through the most untamed wilderness without getting lost. It also allows them to tell the time.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Without proper equipment, a character can only give rough estimations of where they are, anchored on larger geographic features (like mountains or rivers but not towns or roads) to the nearest 10 miles.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SCAVENGING </strong>There’s a gift in high-speed appraisal. This is often used by those picking over battlefields for anything they could sell, but it’s also found a niche with adventurers who use it to find food and sustenance while traveling away from civilization.</p><p style="margin:0px;">A Check vs +0 tells a character which of two things considered is worth more. This can’t be used for coinage, but can be any other type of good. It also gives the character an idea of whether broken equipment can be reasonably salvaged.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This doesn’t give even a ballpark of what anything is worth, but it only takes a few seconds of consideration. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If using this Skill to scavenge for food, use the rules presented in the Botany section, however, two or more Complications results in you eating something poisonous.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SNARING </strong>This teaches the character how to properly create and place snares to trap smaller wildlife. It also gives some cursory knowledge on the best places to put them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Snares have a chance of giving you food once a week, although you’ll only actually roll when you Check them. Every Boon you get gives you half a day’s worth of food.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HUNTING </strong>Most of the time, you’re not going to down your query in one go, and so the hunt is on as your watch for subtle signs of their passing. While this Skill was originally used to hunt wildlife, it has been repurposed by wardens and bounty hunters trying to capture the most dangerous game.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Hunting Skill can be used to track your prey, get a sense of their movements, and predict where they’re going. It can also give insight into common and uncommon natural creatures.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you’re using it for food, hunting is a boom or bust strategy: at the end of each full day you spend hunting, roll a Check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For each Boon you gain 2 days’ worth of food, but either way, you gain 1 damage from exhaustion and possibly more if you suffer a Complication.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">USE ROPE </strong>Covering all kinds of knots and bindings, the Use Rope Skill is pretty self-explanatory, though it should be noted that you can also use this Skill to get a sense of the tensile strength of a rope or how much you’re going to need for a certain job.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">To keep your players on their toes, I suggest you make the Check, not when they tie the knot, but when it’s tested.</p><h4>TACTIC SKILL SUITE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Combat isn’t just about raw physical power, but more about how it’s directed and used. This Skill Suite deals with logistics and making the most out of what you have.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">COMBAT STYLE (STYLE) </strong>By studying the best tactics and how to fight in certain circumstances, a warrior can take advantage of his surroundings and combat styles emerge. Combat Styles can be anything but involved in parts: a situation and a metric. </p><p style="margin:0px;">This situation is when the Combat Style is most effective. For instance, it can be “in the forest”, “fighting on rooftops”, “being outnumbered”, “being in a duel”, “fighting while prone”, etc. Really anything (as long as your GM approves). </p><p style="margin:0px;">The second part of the Combat Style is the metric applied to. This can be anything you could normally specialize in. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Both the situation and metric are selected at the time of purchase and cannot be changed.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If the situation is applicable, the character receives a +1 to that metric for every 2 Ranks of that Skill he’s obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, a character with the Combat Skill (unarmed fighting, attack) at 5 who gets into a tavern brawl gets a +2 to attack as long as he doesn’t draw his weapon and simply uses fisticuffs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Having a high Rank in Tactics doesn't automatically give you Combat Style bonuses under all circumstances and buying this Skill for the first time starts it off at Rank 0, instead of the Tactic Suite's Rank.</p><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Distraction Check </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Difficulty</td><td>Time</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+0</td><td>1 Minute</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>+d4!</td><td>2 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+d6!</td><td>5 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>+d8!</td><td>10 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+d10!</td><td>30 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>+d12!</td><td>1 Hour</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DISTRACTION </strong>More than simply yelling “hey, look” at someone, the art of distraction is the art of holding people’s attention. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The amount of time that someone is delayed is based on the Difficulty of the Check and how bent on their current activity they are.</p><p style="margin:0px;">On a success, the person (or persons) is distracted for the amount of time according to the Difficulty * half the number of Boons, rounded up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This isn’t magical: an obvious threat to their person will cause the person to focus in.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This Skill is less effective when the person knows they’re in immediate danger. In this case, as long as they’re not actively engaged in melee with someone (in which case it’s an instant failure under most circumstances), the person is distracted for seconds, instead of minutes. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Each successive Check’s Difficulty gets increased by 2 dice sizes in these cases.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LEADERSHIP </strong>The difference between a leader and an administrator is that the latter gets stuff done and the former gets others to get stuff done but hooking into what they believe and how they view themselves.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Assuming you have a willing audience, you may make a Leadership Skill Check vs +0 pointed at a Characteristic you think the person or group might have. </p><p style="margin:0px;">If you succeed the Check and they have the Characteristic you’re looking for (or close enough - you don’t have to be exact), you increase their Panic threshold by 1 step for the next d4! hours. Gaining 4 or more Boon increases it by 2 steps.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can increase the number of Characteristics you’re aiming for by increasing the Difficulty dice size of the Check by a similar number.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">QUARTER MASTERING </strong>There’s an art to packing and making sure that everyone is well fed and prepared. If the quartermaster is using a personal container of any kind, he adds 2S for each Rank he has in this Skill. Otherwise, he adds 1S per Rank. This also applies to any person he packs for.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RALLY </strong>When manure hits the windmill, no speeches or grand narratives will keep a person from bolting. Only the cold will of a competent commander can keep a battle from becoming a route. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A captain who successfully makes a Check vs +) for someone who is currently over their Stress Threshold, heals that person a number of Stress equal to 3 * his number of Boons. This is opposed by the enemy captain, if applicable, and each Check against the same target increases the Difficulty by 1 dice size, regardless of whether it was successful or not.</p><table style="width:250px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Recruiting Check </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Difficulty</td><td>Location</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-d10!</td><td>Capital (pop +200,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-d6!</td><td>Large City (pop +100,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-4d!</td><td>Medium City (pop +15,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>+0</td><td>Small City (pop +8,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+d4!</td><td>Large Town (pop +1,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>+d6!</td><td>Medium Town (pop +500)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+d10!</td><td>Small Town (pop +20)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>+d20!</td><td>Wilderness</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RECRUITING </strong>Knowing where to find the right person is a crucial Skill for any long-term expedition. A character with this Skill can find a random person willing to hire on with a Check vs +0 in 2d6! days.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Now, finding specialists or someone with a certain Skill is another matter. Every additional criteria increases the Difficulty by 1 dice size.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Where you’re looking also makes a difference, as well.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This doesn’t guarantee that the person found will take the job or doesn’t have some serious issues, like a crippling fear of dogs: it only guarantees that they have the Skills you’re looking for and that they’re somewhat interested in being hired on. Pay and comfort make a lot of difference to a prospective hire.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RIDING </strong>This Skill teaches a character how to maintain their stability while on horseback and makes them capable of feats of equine prowess.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The bonuses for this Skill are varied and many with the specifics spelled out in Chapter 9: Combat under the Mounted Combat section so they won't be listed here. Seriously, go Check it out.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SIGNALLING </strong>This is the knowledge of how to communicate over long distances, either using semaphore, smoke signals, signal lamps, or horn blowing.</p><p style="margin:0px;">When using this means of communication, each side rolls a Check based on how complicated the message is and how quickly they need to send it. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Signaling is an ad hoc language with no grammatical rules or complicated tenses and so even at the best of times, only simple messages can be sent.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">WARFARE </strong>The Warfare Skill hands directing troops on the battlefield, weighing options, and devising plans on the fly. </p><p style="margin:0px;">Those with this Skill can roll it to temporarily pause combat to ask one question and receive one answer from a specific member of the party, or to simply tell them something. On top of this, you can also use this, out of combat, to confer with players who’re characters are not present in the scene.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Checks start at +0 Difficulty but increase by 1 dice size each time they’ve been rolled that combat.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Warfare also has additional benefits and uses that will be outlined in Crowns of Fire, the kingdom management and mass combat supplement for Bonfire.</p><h4>TRADES SKILL SUITE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This suite covers the crafting and creating Skills. While there are a wide array and breadth of professions, this list is pared down to those areas of knowledge where the common man and the adventurer overlap in their needs. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">APPRAISAL (SPECIFIC) </strong>It’s wise to know what something is worth before selling and buying it. This Skill handles that and is taken for a specific type of good, such as books & scrolls, livestock, jewelry, arms & armor, and so on.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If a character has the appropriate Skill covering the item he’s looking to sell/purchase, a Check will tell them what kind of deal they're getting on the item - how much they’re being ripped off or how much of a steal it actually is.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Additionally, the character should get a bonus if he has any Skill that’s applicable to the thing he’s purchasing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ARTICULATION </strong>You may think that the truth is powerful enough to carry your argument, but you can be beat out by a master of deception. Articulation is the Skill of rhetoric and formulating the truth in such a way that makes it the most convincing.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The level of Difficulty to convince someone is how much evidence you can supply to back up your arguments. This is opposed by Deception or Articulation but only if someone is actively trying to deceive or convince the same person as you.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that the Difficulty of their Deception Check may add bonus dice to your Articulation Check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Even if you succeed, this isn’t a permanent way of changing a person’s mind. Others may lie more effectively than you can tell the truth and that may cause them to rethink their opinion on what you tried to sell them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ARTISTRY (SPECIFIC) </strong>While some may not find the Fine Arts a worthy way to spend time, others may disagree. Artistry covers all artistic endeavors, including painting, sculpture, embroidery and anything else that is done for art’s sake. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">COOKING/BAKING </strong>On the road, a hot meal can count for a lot. A character who has a hot meal gains 1 Relaxation for every soft success the cook had on their Check.</p><p style="margin:0px;">On top of this, a character can prepare otherwise unpalatable or poisonous food in such a way as to make the most of it, though it is a Check vs d12! to do so.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Unless the character is trying to prepare a feast worthy of His Imperial Majesty, basic daily cooking only requires a Check vs +0.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CRAFT (SPECIFIC) </strong>This Skill covers any Skill that makes something that isn’t noted here, such as carpentry, tailoring, basket weaving, pottery, etc. The GM may adjust the price for a particularly difficult to master study.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LEATHERWORKING </strong>From the moment it leaves the beast to the moment the final touches are finished, leatherworking handles the process of making and crafting works from the hides of animals, including skinning and tanning.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MAINTENANCE </strong>The Skill of tinkers and adventurers, this gives the person a general knowledge of easy and ad hoc fixes that can be done on the fly. </p><p style="margin:0px;">A successful Check lowers the Wear on the item by 1. The level of Difficulty in repairing something is equal to the Wear on the item, rounded up to the nearest dice size.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So repairing a spear with 1 Wear is a d4!, while repairing one with a 5 Wear is a d6!.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Another Check can't be made until the item gains more Wear.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">METALWORKING </strong>This covers the process of changing crude ore into a beautiful weapon, armor, or decorative piece. It also covers the construction and repair of more mundane things, like plows, but if you’re picking this Skill up, I doubt you’re doing it to corner the farmer’s market.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MUSICIAN (SPECIFIC) </strong>This covers the mastery of specific instruments, including singing. At the end of the day, the dulcet tones of a neatly played mandolin can ease the ache of a long day. </p><p style="margin:0px;">A character who hears someone play an instrument gains 1 Relaxation for every Boon the player had on his Check. This doesn’t stack with others playing; however, you will take the highest roll and use that to determine Relaxation. It also does no good if you’re in a stressful situation, like being hunted.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Unless the character is trying to serenade a queen, basic daily ditties only require a Check vs +0.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PERFORMANCE </strong>This Skill covers everything from making your case before a court or a stirring speech before charging into battle. </p><p style="margin:0px;">On a success, anyone listening gains a temporary Devotion to what the performer wants: whether that’s themselves or an organization or a case. If the Devotion already exists, the size is temporarily increased. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Devotions strength is equal to the number of Boons the performer had.</p><h4>WEIRDCRAFT SKILL SUITE</h4><p style="margin:0px;">The science of the Weird is an oft studied but little understood branch of knowledge that requires a deep knowledge of the nature of the Painted World.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">With this Skill Suite, someone can identify a spell, point out needed regents and processes for ritual shapings, detect if something is touched by the Weird and what its properties are, or even detect if a spell has been cast in an area, and have a chance of finding out what it was.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ALL ADVANCED WEIRDCRAFT SKILLS </strong>Unlike other Advanced Skilled, the Weirdcraft Advanced Skills pretty much work the same and so don't need their own section.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The first bonus that having an Advanced Weirdcraft Skill gives you is that it gives you further insight into a particular Weird Tradition, allowing you to detect it better. For more information on what each Tradition specializes in, head over to Chapter 11: The Weird.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The other thing it does is allow you to shape cantrip versions of spells from that Tradition, regardless of Archetype. The ability to shape is inherit in all living things though it takes decades of practice, a strong family bloodline, and/or a natural gift to do what Weird-Adept Archetypes do, a form of practical "folkweird" is often passed down as part of the tools of the trade.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This doesn't, and will never, allow someone to shape the full version of a spell but it can give them a boost or an edge. The specific details should be left up to the GM and player, but they should always be appropriate to the Tradition and never be more powerful than a spell that does the same thing. Most commonly this will mean it will get used as a Helper Skill.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Shaping a cantrip is still shaping and is stressful and so that anytime any of these Skills are used to shape, the shaper gets 2d6! Stress.</p><h1>Confrontation</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character is a multi-faceted representation of a fictional persona. She has her hopes and her dreams, her strengths and her weakness. All of these add up to hopefully make someone that has a compelling story of victory over her flaws, or defeat from the same. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> In game play terms, these are represented by 6 characteristics:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GOALS</strong> represent what your character is trying to achieve.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRAITS</strong> represent what sets your character apart from other characters.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DEVOTIONS</strong> represent their relationships, either with people, organizations, or otherworldly powers.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">REPUTATION</strong> represent how other people see them - what are they rumored to have done or what kind of people do others think they are.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FLAWS</strong> are also considered Characteristics so they're back!</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These characteristics will be provided dice that will be used in Confrontations addressed below and represents how strong it is, with the bigger the dice, the better it is.</p><h2>Goals</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Characters can start with up to 3 Goals, but needs to have at least one at all times. They receive Experience and Honor, as well as increasing the other 3 Characteristics, as you progress along the path to completing them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> What does you character want? Why can’t they get it? These are the two fundamental questions that should be answered for each Goal. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Overlapping Characteristics</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> You may think you’re pretty smart by having a Trait and Devotion both be the same thing so that you always get to roll them at the same time. However, consider that you’re putting your eggs in one basket and it would be worth it to vary it a little to cover more bases, allowing you to use them more often and perhaps leveraging characteristics to bring in others.</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"> Ideally, they should include other party members and the overarching plot of the campaign. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> These goals can be anything from the incorporeal (“I want to find a home” or “I want to deal with this anger inside me”) to the very concrete (“I want to find my father’s sword” or “I want to stop this invasion”).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The best goals are those that are measurable and obtainable.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Being motivated by a Goal allows you to push yourself beyond what you thought was possible. When a Goal applies to a Confrontation, when you lose an Appeal, you take half the Stress.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Starting Characteristics</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> If you’re bringing in a new character to a new campaign, it’s highly probable that you won’t know what the game is going to be about, especially if the GM wants to keep it a secret.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> It’s perfectly acceptable to leave your Goals, Traits, and/or Devotions blank until you’ve got your feet under you, but you should have at least a few Medium term goals and your strongest Trait filled out relating to your character’s personal arch. </p></td></tr></table><h2>Traits</h2><table style="width:350px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="6" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Trait Dice </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Charisma</td><td>Weak</td><td>Weak</td><td>Medium</td><td>Medium</td><td>Strong</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1 - 5</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d4!</td><td>2d4!</td><td>3d4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6 - 7</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d4!</td><td>2d4!</td><td>3d6!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>8 - 9</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d4!</td><td>2d4!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>10 - 11</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d4!</td><td>2d6!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>12</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d6!</td><td>2d6!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>13</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d6!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>14</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>15</td><td>d4!</td><td>d6!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>16</td><td>d4!</td><td>d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>17</td><td>d6!</td><td>d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>18</td><td>d8!</td><td>d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>19</td><td>d8!</td><td>d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>3d10!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>20</td><td>d8!</td><td>d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>2d10!</td><td>3d10!</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"> Traits are things that stick out about your character. Things that people tend to notice about them or that the character defines his identity by. These can be something specific (“I have blonde hair”) or something general (“I have an intimidating demeanor”) or somewhere in between (“I’m an orc”).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Traits don’t have to be physical in nature. It could be how your character views himself (“I’m confident” or “I’m good at math”). They can also be something about your character that he just can’t explain (“I’ve always been good with dogs” or “I can read people easily”).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The sky's the limit when it comes to Traits, so go wild, though they can't have exceptions. So, "I'm an angry person" works but "I'm an angry person but I don't let it affect my work" doesn't.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You start off with 5 Traits of varying levels: 2 weak, 2 average, and 1 strong. These are represented by dice of varying size. How strong these Traits are depends on your Charisma. So, if you have a 13 Charisma, you gain 5 Traits - two at d4, one 2d6, one 2d8, and one at 3d8</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While naturally charismatic characters come out of the gate with strong personalities, as you adventure, your character will also grow and change, gaining and strengthening their Traits. This can be done by either increasing your Charisma, which also raises your Traits, or by buying Traits up directly.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Thinking of Traits</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> Thinking of Traits on the fly is hard. For new players, there's two ways of handling this: either picture a character from fiction you like or find interesting, and try to describe them. These are their Traits, and you can crib off them to start with.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Or if you have no idea where to start or are just a risk taker, you can use the Trait Generator, which will give you a random Trait. These Traits may not always make sense, but they can often serve as a jumping off point for your imagination.</p><p>You can find it in Chapter 9 on the Bonfire SRD</p></td></tr></table><h4>ASSIGNING YOUR TRAIT POINTS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> If you want a little more control over your Traits, their strength and how many, instead of just accepting what's on the above chart, you can use your Trait points from Charisma to modify your Traits how you will. You start off with 5 Traits of varying levels: 2 weak (1d4 each), 2 average (2d4 each), and 1 strong (3d4). This is instead of what you would have gotten.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> From there, you buy up your Traits using those points in the same way as if you were buying them up with CrP. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can also then go back and further increase them with CrP but only after you're done using all your Trait Points.</p><h4>INCREASING TRAITS WITH CrP</h4><table style="width:350px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="5" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Trait Increase Cost </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td> </td><td>Weak (1dX)</td><td>Medium (2dX)</td><td>Medium (3dX)</td><td>Strong (4dX)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Xd4</td><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Xd6</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>14</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Xd8</td><td>5</td><td>12</td><td>10</td><td>18</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Xd10</td><td>4</td><td>16</td><td>10</td><td>22</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Xd12</td><td>3</td><td>20</td><td>10</td><td>26</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"> If you want to increase your Traits further, you can spend CrP to give them a boost. This represents your character spending time developing their personality rather than spending time learning other things. If you built your character using the free version of the rules and are now switching over to Deluxe, you can refund your Trait buy ups to redo them, but only once. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Weak, Medium, and Strong Traits all cost different amounts to raise. Why? Well, in the Basic game, there was a very simple strategy to winning and we wanted to keep things simple so you could learn the basics. Now we're giving you the power to try different ways of convincing people so we needed to make sure the numbers made sense and that you weren't "wasting" your CrP were it wouldn't benefit you, so you'll notice that Weak Traits actually get cheaper the more you buy. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can also buy new Traits for the base Xd4 price. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Please note that you can't buy a Trait past a d12 </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Starting Characteristics</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> If you’re bringing in a new character to a new campaign, it’s highly probable that you won’t know what the game is going to be about, especially if the GM wants to keep it a secret.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> It’s perfectly acceptable to leave your Goals, Traits, and/or Devotions blank until you’ve got your feet under you but you should have at least a few Medium term goals and your strongest Trait filled out relating to your character’s personal arch. </p></td></tr></table><h2>Racial Temperament</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> Your Racial Temperament also tends to come into play fairly regularly during Confrontations. Like a Trait, you can add its dice in an Appeal. But what is the dice size? Well, it's your Honor Dice. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, basically, if your Racial Temperament applies, you get your Honor Dice that round. Pretty easy, pretty straightforward. </p><h2>Devotions</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> The final aspect are the Devotions that your character has. What relationships does he have? What organizations does your character associate with? Is he religious and, if so, is his loyalty more to his cult or to his god? How does he feel about that thing?</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Relationships between individuals don’t need to be reciprocal or even contemporary. A young fighter may be inspired by a girl who doesn't love him back or by a long dead king he greatly admires. These are still viable candidates for his Devotion.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Everyone receives two free Devotions: one to their character’s clan/family and another of their choice. Each Devotion comes with a "relationship verb" and the thing itself. So, his clan Devotion could be "Hate Clan" or "Have mixed feelings about Clan" or "Loyal to Clan"</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These Devotions start a 2.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Devotions are a more powerful driving force than other Characteristics, meaning that, if a Devotion applies, you automatically subtract 1 point for every point you have in it. So, if you approach a blood enemy, trying to convince him to help you, even if you’re being entirely reasonable, it’ll be much harder to do so.</p><h4>BUYING NEW AND INCREASING DEVOTIONS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> All new Devotions start at 1 and cost 4 CrP to purchase. From there, you can increase their size which costs 6 + (2 * your current Devotion). So, to go from a 2 to a 3 Devotion, it'll cost you 10 CrP ( 6 + ( 2 * 2 ) ).</p><h2>Reputation</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Reputation, in a nutshell, is what your character is known for and how other people see them. So, if you want to convince someone that you’ll keep your word, having a Reputation for doing so will help you out.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Reputation takes the form of 3 incomplete sentences starting with “I’m known for...”. Each time you level up, your GM will finish or change out one or more of those sentences and assign points to them that represent their strength. She’ll choose how to finish them based on how your character has been acting or the results of their actions.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">That’s right: just like in real life, you don’t really have control over your Reputation, though there is a way to influence it as you go.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In a Confrontation, Reputation counts as a form of Evidence, but instead of getting the standard 3 points, you instead get the Reputation’s strength in points. It can be combined with other Evidence or adds a number of Honor Dice equal to its strength if you're using it as an Appeal.</p><h2>Flaws</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> Let's circle back to Flaws because they are considered part of your Confrontation Characteristics, after all, they make up who your character is as well. You start with your Flaws giving you 1d4! + your current total Stress you have in Confrontations should you bring them in. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Using your Flaws in such a way is extremely relaxing and so removes any Stress gained during that Confrontation.</p><h2>When To Use These Rules</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These rules may not be appropriate to break out every time two people talk to each other, or even disagree on something. They’re more of a framework that help you track how compelling a side is and, you’ll find, that you can quietly use these rules in the background as your players roleplay.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While there are other reasons to start a Confrontation, they’ll mainly be started by you for a specific purpose: things situations are covered by the Game Master’s Guide so what we’ll talk about here is when to know when a player-initiated Confrontation should happen and that’s fairly easy.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Think of your NPCs in terms of their <strong style="color:#B45F06;">GOALS</strong> and <strong style="color:#B45F06;">METHODS</strong>. Goals are pretty obvious and map one-to-one with the Goal Characteristics, but Methods are how they get things done based on their Characteristics. Methods are kind of the NPC’s morality.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If the NPC feels like what the player is asking them to do aligns with their Goals and their Methods, no Confrontation happens: they don’t need to be convinced.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If, on the other hand, the Goal aligns but the Methods do or if the Methods align but the Goal doesn’t, a Confrontation is a great tool for determining whether the NPC agrees.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">And if neither Goal nor Method aligns, no Confrontation happens: The NPC can’t be convinced.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Of course, if you think it’s reasonable, the players can enter into a Confrontation to convince the NPC that their Goals and Methods align, but that’s up to you and how much the players are trying to abuse it.</p><h2>Playing Out the Confrontation</h2><p style="margin:0px;">The Confrontation is done in a series of back-and-forths called “rounds”, in which each person is trying to get the other person to back down. This involves an argument-counterargument structure. </p><p style="margin:0px;">A round starts when someone puts forth an argument and ends when the other person feels they’ve countered it or they’ve had to concede, so a round can be multiple exchanges with each side talking back and forth, asking and answering questions.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Both sides begin with points equal to any applicable Devotions they have, with the side who didn’t starting with an extra 1 point.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Arguments come in two flavors: Evidence and Appeals.</p><h4>EVIDENCE</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Evidence is facts: things that are believed to be true, even if they’re not true in actuality.</p><p style="margin:0px;">These are flexes in power: I’m the king and so do you a favor if you do this for me.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These are also things you know about the other person, or subjects involved: if you know that a person is caring or has a temper, you can use that against them as Evidence.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If your opponent concedes to your Evidence, you get 3 points, otherwise no one gets anything. Note that the only thing your Evidence needs to be considered counted by your opponent is the fact that your opponent believes it, honestly.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, while a normal person has to concede to the sky being blue, a color blind one could counter with the fact that the sky isn’t blue to them and that’s valid.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Evidence is the surest way of convincing your opponent, but it also tends to be more work: you have to know about your opponent and know their situation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Generally, this is signaled by placing a finger up in the air or pressing it against the table.</p><h4>APPEALS</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Appeals are appeals to a person’s emotions, their sense of self, or their Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Traits are often (but not always) used this way. It can sometimes be a jab at someone’s character or an insinuation of skill, through bragging about how good of a climber you are or maybe displaying your weapon in a threatening manner. It can also be how famous your character is. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Appeals vary in the number of points they get you.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Versus Evidence, Appealing is considered to be talking past someone to go straight for the emotions. The Appealer gets them as many points and Stress as dice you put up, but it also gives the other side 3 points.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Versus another Appeal, each person rolls the dice assigned to the Characteristic they’re using. </p><p style="margin:0px;">The person who rolls the highest total gets that points equal to the number of dice they rolled and half that much Stress, rounded up. So, if they roll 3 dice, and win, they get 3 points and 2 Stress.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The other person gets nothing but gets Stress equal to the number of dice they rolled.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This makes this a sound move for very charismatic people, but it is still risky.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This is signaled by placing the dice in front of you, or holding them up, though you’re not obliged to reveal how many or their sizes.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Tracking Points</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Each side is responsible for their own points but to make it easier, you can use the E/A method. </p><p style="margin:0px;">Write an E and A on top of each other, and then draw a line between them. When you gain points through Evidence, put a single tally next to the E. </p><p style="margin:0px;">When you win an Appeal, note how many dice are added by the A. </p><p style="margin:0px;">When you're totaling your points at the end just multiple the tallies next to E by 3 and add that to the sum of the numbers by A. This should allow you to quickly jot things down and keep them straight during the Confrontation.</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Here’s some areas you can use to Appeal to your enemy and what their corresponding dice might be: </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HONOR </strong>Your standing can carry you through the day, even if your arguments are weak. The character with the highest Honor gets to apply a free use of their Honor die to their pool.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STRESS </strong>When your opponent is overworked and they're at maximum whelm, it's much easier to get them to give in. You can redeem a d4! worth of Leverage for every Stress penalty your opponent has, however, you don't have to redeem all the d4!s all in one round and can spread them out over the course of the Confrontation.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EQUIPMENT </strong>It may be the case that equipment can sway an argument. Often this is through imitation or torture, but gold can also persuade a hesitant sellsword or the right equipment might convince a thief to take on a risky job. A badge of authority may also win you some influence.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Equipment used for this purpose gains the character a base d8. Equipment that’s substandard or that’s being re-purposed from its original use (a knotted rope used to whip a victim, or a broken glass bottle used to threaten someone) only nets a d4.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STAT CONFRONTATION DIE </strong>Having an exceptionally high Strength or Dexterity might be relevant to the situation. If that’s the case, add that Abilities Confrontation Die to your pool.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">APPLICABLE SKILLS </strong>You may roll an additional die for any applicable Advanced skill based on that Skill’s Rank. Take the Rank of that Skill and round up to the nearest dice size. So, a Rank 5 Skill would net a d6 dice while a Rank 14 Skill would net a d20.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But that is by no means a comprehensive list and plays should be rewarded for out-of-the-box thinking. Appeals start at a d4!, but this can vary. For instance, a very skilled swordsman with a lot of Advanced Training in his weapon of choice makes a more powerful Appeal than a rookie. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can use the same Appeal multiple times during a single Confrontation.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Characteristic as Evidence vs Appeals</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There’s no hard rule that can be given of when a Trait qualifies as one over the other, but there are some guidelines.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Generally, if the person whose Characteristic is being used is not directly involved and they’re known by both parties, it is Evidence.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If, however, one of the people is involved in the argument, especially if it is defense, or you’re trying to bring in the Characteristic of someone that the other person doesn’t know, then it is considered an Appeal. </p></td></tr></table><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Evidence as an Appeal</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Truthfully, there may be a time where you have Evidence but it's in your best interest to reinforce the idea with emotion that makes it closer to an Appeal than Evidence. </p><p style="margin:0px;">In this case, you treat the Evidence as an Appeal with a base dice pool of your Intellect or Charisma's Confrontation Die, a die from your Articulation Skill (if you don't have that skill, you don't get this dice), and your Honor Die for the argument itself. From there, you can add other Characteristics to the pool.</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The GM can say no to a proposal if the counter argument doesn’t directly relate to the argument, so careful phrasing could limit what your opponent can do. This is usually the indication that the round isn’t finished yet and the person who was rebuffed can try a different tact or argument.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Bluffing, or in other words, Lying</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">As per normal, a character only needs to roll a Deception Check if the other person is suspicious of them, but even then, if one side accuses the other of something, trying to get them to reveal a secret, they can use Deception to try and bluff, hiding their actual reaction.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If the person is, in fact, telling the truth but someone is still suspicious of them, they’d roll an Articulation Check to convince their accuser of their sincerity.</p></td></tr></table><h4>PANIC THRESHOLD</h4><table style="width:175px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Starting Panic Threshold </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Honor</td><td>Panic</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Great</td><td>Never</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>High</td><td>Critical</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Average</td><td>Wounded</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Low</td><td>Bloodied</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Dishonor</td><td>Hurt</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;">A strong willed or well disciplined person, when faced with insurmountable odds will often fight and/or argue long after the cowards have run, either gaining victory or assuring his death. Targeting these weaker willed people might also make or break a side. This is represented by a character’s Panic Threshold.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Check the character’s Honor to determine their starting Panic Threshold. Record this for your character by circling the Wound Category in your Vitality Section. When you reach that Wound Category, you become Panicked.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Panicked people have several disadvantagous: the first being that they half their Stress Threshold until they're out of danger or the argument they're in (often just conceding to get away).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The second is that they gain double the amount of Stress from Appeals, win or lose.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In combat, a Panicked person can't take aggressive actions: they'll still attack, but if the other side flees, they won't chase them and they'll try to fall back to more defensible positions, if they can. </p><p style="margin:0px;">If a person goes above their Stress Threshold, they immediately lose the Confrontation. If they're in combat, they simply turn and flee, unable to face their own morality. Captains can try and rally them with a Check immediately.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If cornered and given no space to run, these routed fighters enter a frenzy - only using aggressive Tactics and becoming immune to Stress penalties.</p><h4>FAST TALKING </h4><p style="margin:0px;">There may be times when you don’t want to/can’t get into a protracted argument and just want to overwhelm your opponent into agreeing with you. For example, you need to fast talk your way past a guard or convince a henchmen to go first down a trap filled corridor before he remembers he doesn’t have insurance.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In those cases, you want to fast talk the person.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This is, essentially, a Confrontation in a single round: either by showing a blatant, time-sensitive, piece of Evidence (“Let me in! The orcs are RIGHT THERE”) or by making an Appeal that stuns the person with your Charisma.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the person can’t match you or beat you, you won them over: for the next 30 minutes or so and then they’ll come calling.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Fast Talking is not a way to permanently get a person on your side - it is a band-aid tactic to buy you a little extra time.</p><h4>ENDING THE ROUND</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Like I said, a round ends when an argument is countered or conceded.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Quickly jot down the points gained that round and move on.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These points are kept secret until the end of the Confrontation.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Multiple People in a Confrontation</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can, of course, have people help out in a variety of support roles during a Confrontation but they can often trip over each other, giving the opposition a chance to rebuttal.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The big thing to note is that, if you’re not careful, you can step on each other’s toes as the opposition can choose which argument to focus on if many are provided, allowing them to peak the weakest one.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if multiple emotional Appeals are presented, he can pick the lowest result.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This doesn’t mean that those arguments are wasted: they can be reused later in the Confrontation and, in fact, seeing which arguments the opposition chooses to ignore might give you some clues about where their argument is weakest.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Players may take sidebars, of course, (See the Taking a Break Sidebar below) but they may also use the Warfare Advanced Skill to temporarily pause and discuss with each other.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you’re facing multiple people, note that any Evidence has to apply to/be believed by everyone on the opposition to be effective, thus making Evidence less and less helpful in a situation where you have to convince a group or mob.</p></td></tr></table><h4>TRUMP CARDS</h4><p style="margin:0px;">There are some arguments that are so good that they can counter multiple points. These are considered trump cards and should be played carefully because they can only counter arguments that your opponent has already put forward.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Trump cards give a number of points equal to their base times the number of arguments they counter. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if you put forward Evidence that counters 3 arguments, it would give you 9 points, while having a 4 dice Appeal that counts against the same number gives you 12 points.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">It doesn’t matter if the arguments have already been counter, in fact, that’s when you get the most benefit out of trump cards.</p><h4>ESCALATING A CONFLICT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A debate between friends is on a different level than two enemies mudslinging or threatening to cut each other’s throat if the other doesn’t listen. This is represented by levels of escalation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At baseline, the Confrontation is simply a battle of ideas, with each side having no person stake in the matter. It is the default and only inflicts Stress.</p><p style="margin:0px;">However, one or either side can make it <strong style="color:#B45F06;">PERSONAL</strong>, which means pride and personal image is starting to get in the way. This happens when one side uses more than 3 Appeals in a Confrontation or when one side purposely makes an insulting comment.</p><p style="margin:0px;">When a Confrontation becomes Personal, Appeals become more powerful, being worth 1 extra point on a success, however, people often dig their heels into the ground when you start questioning their character, making others things more dangerous.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The first is that you need to not just beat your opponent, but beat his total points by 5 plus a roll of his Honor Dice (which represents his mood).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But, it can be to your benefit: the winner gains Honor equal to how much he beat his opponent by, while the loser loses that much.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Above Personal Confrontations are <strong style="color:#B45F06;">INTIMIDATION</strong> Confrontations. This means that you’re now threatening personal harm to either the person, or someone the person cares about. You can now bring in that shiny blade or talk about what a shame it would be if that person’s house burned down.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This is similar to a Personal Confrontation, except that, if you lose and you don’t then escalate to violence and follow through on your threats, you lose face, losing 5 Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But, if you escalate to violence and also get your buttkicked, you lose 10 Honor so if you’re going to start threatening people, make sure you either win or that you’re as tough as you say you are.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can jump up levels, going from a standard Confrontation to intimidating them in a single round, however, you can’t de-escalate.</p><h4>PUSHING THE POINT</h4><p style="margin:0px;">When one side feels they may have the upper hand and that the other has run out of arguments, they can try to push the point, or end the Confrontation. He simply tries to push the other side to make a decision.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If it turns out that the other person does still have more to say, the Confrontation continues, gaining 1 point.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If, however, it turns out that the pushed person does, in fact, have no more to say, than the Confrontation ends</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Taking a Break</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">It may take days or weeks to sway someone, making sure you know them, their likes and dislikes, and that you’ve got all your bases covered.</p><p style="margin:0px;">In this way, it is perfectly acceptable, should it make sense, that you suspend the Confrontation, possibly indefinitely.</p></td></tr></table><h4>FOLDING</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Folding is what happens when you want to try and give them a lie or are not planning on doing what the winner wants. In this case, you give in early.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If your opponent pushes, you can choose to Fold by saying that you have no more arguments, but if the other person suspects that you’re Folding they can try and call you on it, in which case it's an opposed Deception Check if you are and a Articulation Check if you’re not.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Articulation Check is to make it harder to meta-game whether or not you're bluffing.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you are Folding and you fail the Deception check, the Confrontation continues.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that obviously your accuser now knows you were lying but that doesn’t give them a way to prove to other people that was the case. It’s communicated to them with a definite drop in the voice or the way you looked away.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you’re Folding and succeed at your Deception Check, or if you weren’t and you fail on your Articulation, the accuser pushes the issue but there’s no proof and so he loses face.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The accuser gives you all the Honor he would have gotten from the win and only gains it back if he can prove publicly that you were lying.</p><h2>Ending The Confrontation</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At the end of the Confrontation, both sides reveal their points. The one with the most points gets their way.</p><h1>Combat</h1><h2>Starting A Combat</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Combat engages as soon as both sides are within eyesight, and both know that the other intends harm.</p><h4>The CLOCK</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Clock begins at 1, and then progresses to 2, 3, 4 etc, ad infinitum. When the Clock matches a character’s Initiative, they go. Each of these numbers represent 1 second of time passing. What second a character's next action is referred to as their initiative (or "where they are on the Clock") </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This can be a difficult when you first start so we recommend that you start with only running two or three enemies until you get the hang of it. We've also provided a tool that can help you keep track of the Clock and enemies easier. You can find it <a href="https://combatcounter.dragon-slayer.net/">here</a>.</p><h4>STARTING INITIATIVE & SURPRISE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each side rolls an initiative die. The lower the die, the more prepared they are for the attack, though typically the instigator goes on second 1. Those that know the battle is about to start (like being warned by a predetermined sign) use a d4, and the completely surprised receive a d20, while everyone else typically falls on a dice between that. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Those whose initiative hasn’t come up are surprised and continue to do what they were doing as if nothing is wrong. They can take no other actions: they’re completely unaware of what’s going on.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Should someone attack them during this time, they are completely helpless, defending on a d8!.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If the surprised person is hit, the pain quickly brings them into the reality of the situation, and they may act 2 seconds later (or before that if their initiative was the next second). </p><h4>ACTIONS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Every action takes a certain amount of time. On a character’s Initiative, they declare their action and are told how long that action will take. After that time, the action is complete.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, if a character wants to walk across a room, which will take 8 seconds, and his Initiative is 5, once the Clock reaches 5, he starts walking and once it reaches 14, he’s gotten the other side of the room. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At any point, you may choose to forfeit your action and change your course. If, when halfway across the room (at second 9), the character sees that his buddy is in trouble, he can immediately decide that, no, he’d rather be there, his character stops walking across the room and instead heads over to help his friend. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Keeping track of this can be tricky for new players unused to the system. To help players make the shift, we've created the <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SdyiHUEmgYOpuB6sl5ahDY_KcYbvDl8-/view?usp=sharing">Basic Combat Cheat Sheet</a> that has a strip where you can keep track of when your next action is going to happen. It also includes handy references to other rules found in this chapter as well.</p><h4>MOVEMENT</h4><table style="width:605px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="8" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Movement </th></tr><tr><td colspan="8" style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;">Speed</td></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><th rowspan="0">Size</th></tr><tr style="background: #5c5c5c;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td> </td><td> </td><td>Stroll/Crawl</td><td>Walk</td><td>Jog</td><td>Run</td><td>Sprint</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td> </td><td>Small</td><td>2.5 ft /sec</td><td>2.5 ft /sec</td><td>5 ft /sec</td><td>10 ft /sec</td><td>15 ft /sec</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td> </td><td>Medium</td><td>2.5 ft /sec</td><td>5 ft /sec</td><td>10 ft /sec</td><td>15 ft /sec</td><td>20 ft /sec</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td> </td><td>Large</td><td>5 ft / sec</td><td>7.5 ft / sec</td><td>15 ft /sec</td><td>17.5 ft /sec</td><td>25 ft /sec</td></tr><p style="margin:0px;">While, for the most part, you’ll be using your commonsense to determine how long things will take, to unify at least one thing, movement rates are given below.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A person may move up 1 movement category or down 2 in a second.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Every 10 seconds while Running you take damage. This starts at a d4! but increases by 1 dice size every 10 seconds, capping at a d20!.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> For Sprinting, this happens every 5 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This damage is reduced by your Endurance (or Athletics) Rank, down to a minimum of 0.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You can push your character as hard as you'd like, continuing to take damage until they die from fatigue but if you take damage from Running or Sprinting and you stop, you can't Run or Sprint again until you've waited 10 seconds for every time your damage dice was increased.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Also, moving from a Run to Sprint, or vice versa, doesn’t reset that count, so don’t think you can skip taking damage by moving from a Sprint to a Run, you cheeky devil.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While Running or Sprinting, you're unable to attack or defend yourself</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Tracking Initiative</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Until you get the hang out it, it might be difficult to keep track of when exactly things are happening, which is why we've provided the combat strip on the <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SdyiHUEmgYOpuB6sl5ahDY_KcYbvDl8-/view?usp=sharing">Basic Combat Cheat Sheet</a>, which is that numbered line on the left hand side going 1 to 20. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">To use it, take a marker (dice or a penny works just fine) and place it on your initiative. When that number comes up on the Clock, you do your action and then add the seconds until your next action, looping back around to 0, if needed. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if you attack on second 17 with a weapon with a recovery of 8, place a marker on 17. When the Clock gets to second 17, you attack, and then move the marker to 5 ( since 17 + 8 is above 20, you subtract 20 from it). </p><p style="margin:0px;">You may also find it useful to place markers for other things you want to track, like movement and shooting for ranged fighters or when spells will go off or end. </p></td></tr></table><h4>IMPROVISED WEAPONS</h4><p style="margin:0px;">It is entirely possible that you’ll find yourself unarmed and must defend yourself with a chair leg or broken bottle. In these cases, treat is as a club but penalize it for 3 seconds and drop its Parry to 0 for not being balanced properly.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Now, it’s also possible that you have superhuman strength and so you can rip a door off its hinges and start bashing people with want and abandon. In this case, it’s entirely possible to do more than a zweihander in sheer concussive force, however, you’ll find that because a door (or similar) isn’t properly weighted or balanced, you’ll find yourself taking a long time to swing and unable to defend yourself properly. In extreme cases like these, the GM can give you a Defense Modifier of somewhere around -8 and the Recovery should never be quicker than 20 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">On top of this, these wide swings make an otherwise threatening object easy to dodge and so less of a danger, meaning you may still be counted as unarmed while trying to use it.</p><h4>WEAPON STYLES</h4><p style="margin:0px;">The way your character wields a weapon can tell a lot about their priorities in a combat and a weapon can be versatile in the extreme if some thought is put into how it's held.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">1 HANDED WEAPON WITH SHIELD </strong>This is the standard way your character is assumed to be wielding their weapon.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">1 HANDED WEAPON WITH FREE SECOND HAND </strong>With one hand free, the character can focus a bit more on their defense and seizing openings. They gain a +2 to their Parry and -1 to their Recovery.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">2 1 HANDED WEAPONS </strong>If attacking with both, your primary hand attacks with a d12! while your secondary attacks with a d8!. You only receive your main hand’s Parry, if any. The secondary attacks slightly slower; always attacking a number of seconds equal to its Recovery after the primary makes its attacks.</p><p style="margin:0px;">When defending with one hand, you defend against the first attack against you with a d20!, using the Parry value of the off-hand weapon.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You can only switch Tactics on your primary attack.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If the weapon off-hand weapon is as large as you, you can only attack with it.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">2 1 HANDED WEAPONS (with Ambidextrous Mastery) </strong>f attacking with both, both attack with a d20!. You only receive your main hand’s Parry, if any. The secondary attacks slightly slower; always attacking a number of seconds equal to its Recovery after the primary makes its attacks. </p><p style="margin:0px;">When defending with one, you defend against the first attack against you with a d20!, using the full Parry of one and half the Parry of the other, added together (the combination is your choice).</p><p style="margin:0px;">You can only switch Tactics and Weapon Styles on your primary attack. </p><p style="margin:0px;">If the weapon off-hand is as large as you, you can only attack with it. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">2 HANDING 1 HANDED WEAPONS </strong>Using two hands where one is sufficient allows you to leverage more of your strength and deal a harsher blow but slows you down.</p><p style="margin:0px;">When using this style, you increase your damage by +4, however, you swap out the bonuses for a +3 to Recovery. </p><p style="margin:0px;">This style can’t be effectively used in combat on weapons smaller than your size.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DOUBLE SHIELDS </strong>While it gives no offensive benefit, the double shields style allows you to cover more facings to gain a greater defense. If two shields have overlapping faces, use the higher of the two's Parry.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">WEAPON IN YOUR OFF HAND </strong>This may come about because your main hand is disabled or you just want to show off. But this implies the main hand is free. If not, see the 2 1 Handed Weapons style. </p><p style="margin:0px;">Non-Ambidextrous people attack with a d12! And gain a +5 Recovery penalty to off-handed attacks.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">2 HANDS FREE (NO WEAPON) </strong>If you have no weapons in combat, you’re not really seen as a threat and so an attacker doesn’t really have to do the dance to try to avoid you blows while trying to strike you.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In this style, your opponent attacks at half their weapon Recovery and they get a free attack whenever you try and close in an attack them. That includes moving ranges.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Dropping Your Weapon to Grapple</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Unarmed moves are more effective with two hands rather than one so you may decide to drop your weapon to try and grapple your opponent easier. If the unarmed attack is on the same second that you drop your weapon, your opponent doesn’t receive the free attack on you.</p></td></tr></table><h2>The Combat</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> It is inevitable that if you get into combat, you’ll end up engaged in a melee with your enemy.</p><h4>ZONES of ENGAGEMENT: MEASURING YOUR OPPONENT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are 3 positions that you can have relative to your enemy. These positions aren’t reciprocal by nature: you can be threatened by someone and not have them be threatened by you.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">NOT ENGAGED</strong> This is basically the default. You are too far away for them to reasonable do anything.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">THREATENED</strong> This means that you’re within 5 feet + your opponent’s weapon’s measure. From here, if you move faster than a Jog and if they’re within half their weapon Recovery, they can attack you. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> If you go from Engaged to Threatened, your weapon initiative doesn't reset, so if you become Engaged again for any reason before your weapon's Recovery, you may not attack. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ENGAGED</strong> You’ve closed the distance and can actually make an attack. The person with the highest weapon measure attacks first. If both weapons are exactly the same measure, the attacks happen simultaneously.</p><h4>MELEE ATTACK & DEFENSE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Basic melee attacks always roll a base d20! + any attack modifiers, while defenders rolls a d20! + any defense modifiers</p><h4>PERFECT ATTACKS & DEFENSES</h4><p style="margin:0px;">A Perfect Attack or Defense is one that puts you in a better position to win. A Perfect Attack occurs on an unmodified roll of 20 on your Attack roll, while a Perfect Defense is an unmodified 20 on your Defense roll, but only if your final totals are still greater than you opponent’s. If not, the attack still hits for Perfect Attacks and you still dodge the blow for Perfect Defenses but you don’t gain the auxiliary benefits.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If both those qualifiers are met you gain the following benefits on top of the normal ones:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PERFECT ATTACK </strong>You gain a free automatically successful Unarmed Combat attack. If you have Advanced Training in Unarmed Combat, you may roll for the additional benefit, but even on a failure, you gain the move’s base benefit.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You may also Shift with no penalty and change your Tactic.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you’re firing a ranged weapon, you don’t receive the Unarmed attack, however you managed to hit a sensitive area, lowering their max movement speed by one category, minimum Crawl speed.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PERFECT DEFENSE </strong>You gain a free automatically successful Unarmed Combat attack. If you have Advanced Training in Unarmed Combat, you may roll for the additional benefit, but even on a failure, you gain the move’s benefit.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You may also Shift with no penalty and change your Tactic. </p><p style="margin:0px;">Additionally, you gain a chance to riposte, gaining a free full attack the next second if you’re wielding a melee weapon. This attack doesn’t affect your current count.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">NEAR PERFECT ATTACKS AND DEFENSE </strong>An unmodified roll of 19 on either Attack or Defense results in a Near Perfect Attack or Defense, where you may Shift for no penalty, change your Tactic, or, for attacks, gain an extra d4! to damage, or, for defenses gained a free riposte with your off hand weapon if it’s smaller than your size.</p><h4>RANGED ATTACK & DEFENSE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Ranged attacks and defenses function identical to melee attacks and defenses (including Flanking), only get a few additional bonuses and penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The first is that range (of course) and the second is movement. When defending against a ranged attack, you get a +2 for each Movement Category above standing still. So, if you're getting shot at, get the lead out. </p><h4>COVER</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Cover is anything that gets between you and the person trying to shoot at you.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For solid objects, such as walls, where it is easy to calculate how much of the person is covered, a flat bonus is appropriate. For every 10% covered, you get a +2, so 25% would be a +5, 50% would be a +10 and so on.</p><p style="margin:0px;">For people, tree, a moving object, or really anything that’s harder to calculate, you’ll use a dice backed on the difference in size, starting at a d20. Each difference in size shrinks or increases that cover die by 1 size. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Cover dice for most objects works the same as shields - if you’re behind cover, you add a roll of that dice to your defense. If you’re actively crouching behind it, you add the max it would give you to your defense plus another roll of the dice.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, two medium size people standing one in front of the other would give the guy in the back d20 cover, same as two small sized people. If the person in the front is small sized and the guy in the back is still medium sized, the guy in the back only gains a d12 cover.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the person is actively moving or trying not to be your cover, you can’t gain the bonus for actively crouching behind them.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you don't move, however, cover becomes more and more useless as your shooter sights in. For each shot against you where you haven't moved, you either lower your effective cover percentage by 10 or shrink your cover dice by 1 size, depending on whether the cover is static or not. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note this also applies to shields as well, so if you don't move while using a shield, it becomes less effective. </p><h4>RANGED MISSES</h4><p style="margin:0px;">On a miss with a ranged weapon, the missile doesn’t magically disappear into oblivion. There’s a good chance it might hit someone else, especially if your target is locked in melee.</p><p style="margin:0px;">In the case of a miss, roll a d20! and a d4. The d4 determines to which side the missile strays - an odd result means it goes left, an even result means it goes right.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The d20! determines how many feet it strays from the target. Draw an imaginary line between the archer and that point. Everyone within 5ft of that line needs to roll a defense vs the original attack roll, starting with the person closest to the archer and ending with the furthest possible target.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Inanimate objects may provide enough cover to be considered targets in both Firing into Combat and Ranged Misses, such as a large boulder or tree. In which case, medium sized objects roll a d12!, with each size lower decreasing the dice size by 2, and each size larger increasing the dice size by 2.</p><h4>FIRING INTO MELEE</h4><p style="margin:0px;">If there’s any one within 5 ft of a direct line between the origin of the missile and the target, they’ll have to roll the appropriate defense die vs the original attack roll to see if the missile hits them instead, starting with the person closest to the archer or gunner and ending with the intended target.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">All the normal rolls apply so if the missile only misses because of cover, the missile has lodged itself in the cover and goes no further.</p><h4>DEALING DAMAGE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Once both sides have rolled and added all modifiers, compare the totals against each other.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If the defender’s is equal to or greater than the attacker, the attack misses.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PARRYING</strong> If a melee attack roll is within the Parry Threshold of the defender’s total, the defender may choose to deflect some of the incoming attack.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The attacker rolls their damage and subtracts the shield or weapon’s DR and then their armor’s DR. Any leftover is still done to the defender. For piercing weapons, the /d DR of the shield or weapon is tripled. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, a defender with a Parry Threshold of 4, and a total of 10 for their defense roll vs an attack roll of 14, could choose to parry the blow, taking less damage.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> However, if it’s not, the attack lands and the attacker rolls his weapon’s damage die and adds any appropriate damage modifiers. The defender than subtracts their Damage Reduction and the remaining total is subtracted from their Vitality and added to their list of wounds.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DAMAGE REDUCTION</strong> Armor allows you to reduce the amount of damage taken. This is often times shorted to DR. There are two types: Static, noted by just a number, and Per Die, noted by a number /D.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Static simply subtracts that number from the damage and is done.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> /D subtracts that number multiplied by the number of dice the attack is using. So, if someone is attacking you with a slashing weapon (2d6!), and you have armor that gives you 4/D, you’d subtract 8 from the damage. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Either way, if the attacker chooses to remain in engaged, he then adds his weapon’s Recovery to the current second on the Clock. Once the Clock reaches that new number, he may attack again. </p><h4>BREAKAGE; WEAPON, ARMOR, & SHIELDS</h4><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Shield And Weapon Breakage </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Type</td><td>Threshold</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td colspan="8" style="background: rgb(100, 100, 100);text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;">20</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Shields & Armor</td><td>30</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Other Weapons</td><td>40</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;">When you parry with a shield or weapon, or when your armor absorbs damage, if the damage after DR is greater than a certain threshold, the item gains 1 Wear, which leads to a greater chance of it breaking.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If it doubles or triples this threshold, you gain double and triple the Wear, and so on.</p><p style="margin:0px;">More on Wear can be found in <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/10"]' [queryParams]='{ search : "wearheading"}'>Chapter 10: Equipment</a>.</p><h4>KNOCK-BACKS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the pre-DR damage is higher than your enemy’s Vitality Size Modifier + 1 for every M item you're carrying, the attack also moves them back 5 feet. If it’s twice the damage needed, they get knocked back 10 feet, and so on.</p><h4>VITALITY & DAMAGE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Remember that if you drop a Wound Category you could become Fatigued.</p><h4>TRAUMA</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> If someone does more damage after DR than your Trauma Threshold, that triggers a Con Check vs d20! + the damage dealt.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Failure means that your character has been overcome with pain to the point that he’s unable to act, leaving him completely defenseless for a number of seconds equal to how much he failed by times 3.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Double Trauma</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">A character that gets dealt their full Vitalty in damage in a single blow has suffered a grievous wound - the scar of which, if he survives, will be with him until the day he dies.</p><p style="margin:0px;">When this happens, the trauma is too much and they simply die where they stand if they fail their check. Even if they succeed, they’re still suffer Trauma for the next 30 seconds but gain a wicked looking scar.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Battle scars are marks of pride and honor. Characters who become scared gain a 3d4 Trait “Battle Scars”. If they would get this Trait again, increase all dice by 1 size.</p></td></tr></table><h4>COUP de GRACE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A helpless enemy is one completely at your mercy. If a character is completely helpless, either from failing a Trauma check, being bound, or deep asleep, a character can kill the target instantly. This move takes 10 seconds to complete as it takes a bit of positioning to pull off. The character’s whose throat is being slit gives out a cry of pain as they expire.</p><h4>FACING & FIGHTING MULTIPLE PEOPLE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> The likelihood is that at some point you’ll want to be flanking or someone with want to flank you, to try and gain an advantage.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Defending right in front of you is pretty easy and so brooks no penalties, however, every 45 degrees off that the defender lowers their Defense dice by 1 size, with those being attacked from directly behind defend on a d8! since they take advantage of a huge blind spot.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This penalty can be mitigated through the use of shields. Small shields allow you to defend against an additional assailant, depriving them of that bonus, while Medium and Large ones allow you to defend against an extra 2 and 3, respectively.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A maximum of 8 people at a time can effectively attack person at once, assuming that they’re out in the open. After that, every assailant’s attack die is lowered by 1 size per extra person.</p><h4>TERRAIN & SITUATIONAL FACTORS</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> No battlefield is absolutely flat and featureless and often these features can make a difference for those cunning enough to use them. This section won’t give you all the different situations you might find yourself in, but should give you a good basis to judge off of.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The numbers under the Attack and Defense columns are the change penalty or bonus. If there is a dice noted there, you replace your d20! with that when rolling. So, standing in quicksand gives you a -8 to Defense (amongst other things).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Note that defense penalties also affect ranged defenses.</p><table style="width:600px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="4" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Terrain & Situational Factors </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td> </td><td>Attack</td><td>Defense</td><td>Other Modifiers</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Attacking Around a Corner</td><td>-4</td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Balancing On Something</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>Acrobatics Rank round up to nearest dice size for attack and defense, max d20.

This tactic needs to be committed to for at least your full weapon Recovery. After that you may continue using it and change tactics at any point.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> But focusing on defense does slow you down, since you're zigzagging and trying to juke out your enemy, so your movement is considered 1 Category lower for how far you move. So, if you're Medium sized and Active Dodging while at a Run, you would move at 10 ft / sec, instead of 15. You would still be subject to the damage, however, since you're still technically running. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Active Dodging can be combined with Retreat and Step Back, adding only the attack penalties but gaining all auxiliary benefits from each (so no, the defenses don't stack).</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BRACE YOURSELF</strong> Maybe you look at your opponent and say "No, you move". You root your stance and ready yourself, sacrificing some maneuverability to hold the line and get a better chance of striking first.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> While using this Tactic, a character adds +15 to their Knock-Back Threshold and gains a +1 to their Measure, however, they defend on a d12!. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CALLED SHOT</strong> By carefully aiming your shot, a character can reduce the effects of heavy armor by taking more time to target gaps. When employing this tactic, a character halves their effective number of damage dice (rounded up) for considering /D DR, however, it takes a bit longer to set up the strike and so they increase their Recovery by 3 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Crushing weapons are unable to employ this tactic.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CAREFUL AIMING</strong> By taking a moment or two, you can sight in with any ranged weapon, giving you a better chance to hit your target, however, there are diminishing returns after a bit.</p><p style="margin:0px;">For the first 3 seconds, you gain an increasing bonus of +1 to hit. So, the first second you’re aiming, you get a +1, the next a +2 (for a total of +3), and the third you get a +3 (for a total of +6).</p><p style="margin:0px;">After that, that bonus shrinks by 1 each second. So, the fourth second you get a +2 (for a total of +8) and the fifth second you get a +1 (for a total of +9).</p><p style="margin:0px;">Further delay gives you no bonuses.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CHARGE</strong> A character moving at least a Run can throw their full force behind a blow, knocking their opponent off their guard. If the Attacker has reach, the damage for their next attack is considered doubled for the purposes of determining Knock-Backs, though they defend with a d12! for half their weapon Recovery.</p><p style="margin:0px;">A charge is a terrifying tactic: if the blow lands, the defender takes an amount of Stress equal to how much they were hit by. If they're able to retaliate while the attacker is defending with that d12!, the attack also takes that much Stress.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CHOKING UP ON YOUR WEAPON</strong> When you’ve choked up on your weapon, your weapon’s Measure is halved, and you add that number, rounded down to its Recovery. Your halved Measure is considered your new Measure for determining who attacks first and what Tactics can be employed on you as well.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> However, if an opponent is In Your Guard and you choke up on your weapon, you defend with a standard 1d20! and deal full weapon damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You’re unable to employ this tactic twice if someone again gets within your guard.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FEINT</strong> When performing this move, you (hopefully) get your enemy to commit his guard to a different location than you plan on hitting. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Before you roll, if you declare a Feint, you receive a +5 to that Attack but receive a -3 to Defense until your next attack. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FEND OFF</strong> If your weapon's measure is at least 1 foot greater than your opponent's, you can try and fend them off. This means that you may attack them freely, while they can't do the same to you.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You may only use this Tactic as someone is going from Threatened to Engaged, in which case they're automatically considered to be Fended Off. To full becoming engaged with you, they'll have to knock your weapon aside with a regular attack that deals no damage. Should they hit, they become fully engaged and can attack freely again. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">IN THEIR GUARD</strong> If you're engaged with a person and have a weapon that is at least 1 foot shorter than your opponent, you may attempt to get in their guard. On a successful attack that deals no damage, the shorter weapon fighter has successfully knocked his foe's weapon aside and is no fighting at extreme close range, cause them huge penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The longer weapon may only defend with a d12!. All damage dice is also reduced by one size (3d4! → 3d3!). They may, in turn, employ the Choke Up on Your Weapon Tactic.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FLURRY of BLOWS</strong> This tactic involves releasing a rain of quick attacks that rely more on speed than accuracy or power.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> While employing this tactic, you attack 3 seconds quicker, however, you suffer a -3 to Attack, your damage doesn’t explode, and you gain 1 Stress for every 2 seconds you keep up your onslaught.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">JAB</strong> A strike that is meant to purposely to open your opponent’s guard and get them off their balance by making them shift their defense.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The Jab attack happens at half weapon Recovery (rounded up) for Piercing and Slashing weapons. Instead of a d20!, the defender uses a d12! but on a successful hit, no damage is done, and the defender nets a -1 to their next full defense against a non-jab attack. This penalty doubles with each jab, however, it only lasts until the defender’s next full defense.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Crushing weapons may use this tactic but it’s not any faster than their regular Recovery.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LONG GUARD</strong> By placing your weapon further out in front of you and trying to line the body of the weapon with the defender’s eye line, this may allow a person with a short weapon the first strike.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> While using this tactic, you increase your weapon’s measure by 1/2 ft but you reduce your damage’s largest die by 1 size.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Crushing weapons are unable to employ this tactic.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">POWER ATTACK</strong> This is the fighting equivalent of baseball batting your enemy, swinging with all your might.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> With this attack, you receive a -3 to your Attack and next defense but your damage increases</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Piercing weapons increase 1 die by 1 size. Slashing weapons increase all dice by 1 size and crushing weapons increase its highest die by 2 sizes.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RETREAT</strong> This is a defensive tactic that involves moving directly back at jog or at a 45 degrees angle from your opponent’s blows at a walk.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> After your defense roll, if you declare a Retreat, you receive a +5 to your next Defense roll but also a -5 to your next Attack and must continue to move back until your next attack, either at a jog, if moving directly back, or at a walk, if started to move at a 45 degrees angle.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If your opponent is using the Flurry of Blows, Feint, or the Power Attack tactic, if they do hit, you only receive half damage</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SHIFT</strong> You move at your walking speed to either side of your opponent but suffer a -1 to your next Attack and Defense for every 5 ft you travel before your next Attack or Defense. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> However, if you Shift with another tactic, you don’t receive this penalty and gain a +2 that can be either used to increase a bonus or decrease a penalty from that tactic. You may do this freely with any Tactic except Retreat and Step Back.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Shifting is also used to change Facings so if you’re engaged with an enemy and you Shift. And don’t forget that you get those tasty bonuses from flanking your enemy if they don’t also Shift to face you.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STEP BACK</strong> This is a defensive tactic that involves moving directly back from your opponent’s blows at your walking speed.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Before your defense roll, if you declare a Step Back, you receive a +5 to your next Defense roll but on your next attack roll shrink the damage of your dice based on its type and must continue to move back at a Walking speed until your next attack.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Piercing weapons lower 1 of their dice by 1 size. Slashing lowers all dice by 1 size and crushing lowers their highest die by 2 sizes.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If your opponent is using the Flurry of Blows, Faint, or the Power Attack tactic, if they do hit, you only receive half damage.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Retreat v. Step Back</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While they may seem similar on the surface, these two different tactics have some key differences I thought I’d point out so that you can utilize each better.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> 1. Step Back must be declared before you roll your defense while Retreat can be declared after, meaning that if you see you rolled low before employing them.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> 2. Step Back moves your character straight back, while Retreat allows you to move up to 45° to the left and right, meaning that if you’re going to be backed against a wall, it’s an option to try and skirt your opponent.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> 3. Retreat may be done at a jogging speed, while Step Back is always at a walk.</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STRIKE to BREAK</strong> This has two purposes: to either knock an opponent's weapon aside to delay their attack or to try and shatter your opponent’s weapon/shield/armor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The defender rolls a standard defense die vs the attacker’s regular attack roll.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Should the attack succeed, he delays the defender’s next attack by a number of seconds equal to 1 for every 2 full points he scored above the defender’s total.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The attacker also gains a bonus to damaging what they're aiming for: half the breakage threshold for that item. If the damage is greater than triple this modified breakage threshold, the weapon automatically breaks.</p><h4>UNARMED COMBAT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Unarmed Combat’s primary use is to either disable or control your foe, thus winning the battle by maneuvering, rather than raw damage output.</p><p style="margin:0px;">To use an unarmed attack, roll an attack on a d10!, adding your normal attack modifiers, but also adding your Damage Modifier. Your opponent rolls a regular defense (including shield unless otherwise stated) but also adds their Damage Modifier as well.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Size does count for something: the larger person, if there is one, gains a +6 for each Size Category they have on their opponent. </p><p style="margin:0px;">If you hit, you successfully pulled off the move, dealing your unarmed damage and gaining the benefit of the techinque.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the difference between the attack and defense totals were more than the target’s Vitality Size Modifier, you may gain additional benefits listed in the move. If the difference is double the Target’s Vitality Size Modifier, they may immediately make a second unarmed combat attack for free the same second.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you’re doing the move or defending with two hands, roll your attack on a d20!.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GRAB </strong>This move is meant to disable or gain control of a limb or item, whether that’s their belt, their leg, or their sword. The target must be declared before the roll.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Attempting to grab a shield means the target adds their shield’s unmodified Defense penalty from their roll as well since a larger shield is easier to grab. Additionally, attempting to grab most parts of the body involve grabbing armor, if they're wearing any. Add your target's armor's Skill Adjustment as well as applicable.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The exact bonus will depend on the situation but here are some guidelines:</p><ul><li><strong class='orangeHeader'>WEAPON</strong> The defender gets a free attack if the move isn’t successful but when grabbed it means the defender can no longer attack.</li><li><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHIELD</strong> The defender no longer gains any bonus from their shield but still has the defense and Fatigue penalties.</li><li><strong class='orangeHeader'>ARM</strong> See Weapon if it’s the weapon’s arm and Shield if it’s the shield’s arm. The defender also defends on a d12 vs Pushes and can’t change their facing willingly.</li><li><strong class='orangeHeader'>LEG</strong> Moving above a crawl is impossible and moving at all can only be done after a successful opposed Str check vs d20! + the grabber’s strength. </li></ul><p style="margin:0px;">A second grab on a non-body part works as a disarm, wrenching the item free unless secured by something strong, though at the very least, the thing is no longer in hand. This is also done on an additional benefit from a well executed move if the attacker wishes.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PUSH </strong>By pushing you opponent in just the right way, you can move them or shift them in the direction you wish.</p><p style="margin:0px;">On a successful Push, your target changes one facing or moves 5 ft to the left, right, or directly back. You may immediately Shift to follow them without penalty.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You gain an additional facing change or 5 ft of movement on a well-executed Push.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">THROW/TACKLE </strong>This move attempts to throw your opponent to the ground and is easier to pull of if you go prone with them.</p><p style="margin:0px;">For this move, you can increase the attack dice size by 1 if you’re at running speed when you Tackle them. You may increase it by a further 1 if you choose to go to the ground with them, however, no matter what, if you lose the struggle, you still end up on the ground.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Getting forced to the ground resets your opponent's Count and they're considered prone.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The extra bonus for this move is being able to remain standing if you so choose, throw them 5 ft or, possibly disarming them if they fail a Str check vs d20! + your Str.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STRIKE </strong>A strike is a punch with any part of your body or shield. It’s not really about doing damage but more about throwing your opponent off.</p><p style="margin:0px;">On a successful Strike, you delay your opponent’s next attack by 1d4 seconds, though if you’re using a shield to strike, you subtract that shield’s Recovery Mod from that amount, delaying them further. Striking an already stunned opponent is less effective and so the number of second they would be further delayed is lowered by 1 for each time you've successfully struck them since their last attack, down to 0.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The extra bonus for this move is that it increases the time to a d6!.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BREAK FREE </strong>There will probably come a time when you want to break free from a grab, pin, or choke hold.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This is done through the normal unarmed combat resolution method with the following notes:</p><p style="margin:0px;">The first is that the defender rolls a d12! while you roll a full d20! as a base. Additionally, the defender adds their Rank in Escape Artist to the check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The second is that you can only attempt this maneuver every 10 seconds, though this is modified by any Advanced Weapon Basic Training you have in unarmed attack.</p><h4>MOUNTED COMBAT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Whether you're playing a knight or a bounty hunter, you might find it's to your advantage to find yourself something to ride on and you'll probably want to know how you can use that mount in combat, so here are some rules to help you out.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So you’re not making constant Skill Checks all the time, Riding, in this case, is handled a little bit differently. Your mount will have a Turning, Acceleration, and Deceleration stat: this tells you how long, at base, to perform the corresponding action. You can lower all of these base times by up to your Riding Skill, however, you can never go below 3 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can also never perform more than one action at a time and you can’t change actions until the last one you declared is finished since your mount has its own inertia.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TURNING </strong>This is the base time it takes to turn one Facing (45 degrees). This is, however, affected by your speed, adding 1 second to the base time for every Speed Category above Walking your mount is going.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ACCELERATION/DECELERATION </strong>This moves your mount up or down 1 Speed Category, respectively.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DOING SOMETHING DANGEROUS </strong>Your mount might also be smarter than you and decide that it really doesn't want to put itself in danger. This could be charging into a wall of pikes or just a wall. In this case, you’ll have to convince your mount into taking the action.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This acts exactly like a Morale Conflict with the rider adding his Riding Skill as an additional dice and the mount adding its Bravery. Note that if the Bravery is a negative dice, it gets added to the oppositions roll.</p><p style="margin:0px;">And finally, the opposition will also add dice equal to how much damage if could do to the mount (not including DR), though if it’s non-piercing, you’re going to half the damage dice.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Since this is an Appeal, Stress is still given out to both rider and mount.</p><table style="width:250px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="3" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Rider Benefits </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Speed</td><td>Defense Bonus</td><td>KB Bonus</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Standing/Strolling</td><td>+0 (+0)</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Walking</td><td>+2 (+4)</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Jogging</td><td>+4 (+8)</td><td>+10</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Running</td><td>+6 (+12)</td><td>+15</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Sprinting</td><td>+8 (+16)</td><td>+20</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RIDER BENEFITS </strong>So, if you have to think further ahead in combat so that you don't run into anything, what's the point of using a mount? 1) because it's awesome and 2) you get a lot of extra bonuses for doing so.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For starters, if you get +d4! to damage if your opponent isn't mounted or equalizing your height somehow, as well as additional damage dice if you're using a weapon specifically meant to be used from horseback (though you get this die even if you're on a camel, lizard, or what-have you), regardless of height difference.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">On top of this, based on the Speed you're moving, you get a bonus to your Defense and bonus to your effective damage when considering Knock-Back. Should you gain a successful double Knock-Back, your opponent is trampled under hoof, dealing d8! damage and allowing you to continue past them. Note that bonuses to Defense are doubled against ranged attacks, which are the values in parenthesis for ease of reference.</p><table style="width:250px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="3" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Rider Penalties </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Speed</td><td>Attack Dice Size</td><td>Converted (Melee/Ranged)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Standing/Strolling</td><td>-0/-0</td><td>d20!/d20!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Walking</td><td>-1/-2</td><td>d12!/d10!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Jogging</td><td>-2/-4</td><td>d10!/d6!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Running</td><td>-3/-6</td><td>d8!/0</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Sprinting</td><td>-4/-8</td><td>d6!/-d6!</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RIDER PENALTIES </strong>But, of course, it isn't all good news: moving at higher speeds means that it's harder to hit things, especially in ranged combat. </p><p style="margin:0px;">For each Speed Category above Strolling, you lower your Attack Dice by 1 size for melee and 2 sizes for ranged. This can bring you below a d4! and into the negative so lowering 1 size down from a d4! means you roll a d0 and stepping 2 sizes down gives you a -d4! to your attack. A handy table has been provided. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Remember that your Riding Skill Rank does offset this, giving you a +1 to your Attack Dice size for each Rank, which can bring it up past the standard d20!.</p><h4>DYING</h4><p style="margin:0px;">A character who goes passed Critical is dead. The character has died, and the player needs to grab a fresh character sheet and start rolling.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">UNLESS</strong> their character falls under either of two conditions: the combat they’re in directly relates to one of their Goals or they have a Devotion related to a still living character.</p><p style="margin:0px;">In this case, they’re grievously wounded but still up and fighting: the drive to continue their goal being the only thing keeping them alive.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">They can still do everything that any other character can do except that their Stress penalties now apply to their attack and not defense rolls.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If they complete their Goal, the person/thing keeping them fighting has left/died/no longer applies, the combat is over, and/or fail a Trauma check, they then die: there’s no saving them with First Aid, Medicine, or prayers.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Even if healing could be administered during or after battle through any means, it would not help the grievously wounded character: they’re a dead man walking.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FALLEN COMRADES</strong> Watching your friends die around you is extremely Stressful, even if your winning. When a side loses a quarter of their original number (either through dying, going unconscious, or running away), those remaining gain d10! Stress.</p><h2>Morale</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Combat is not simply about who can do the most damage the quickest. Battles, at their heart, are manifestations of the fever of conflict going on between the two sides. This is why sometimes a small, untrained force of zealots can overcome a larger professional army.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This can be represented by a Confrontation happening during the combat, or a Morale Confrontation.</p><h4>MORALE CONFRONTATIONS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At the beginning of combat, if at least one side has a captain, a Confrontation is also started with the two opposing sides are the two opposing forces (the players vs the goblins, for example).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This runs like a normal Confrontation except the company captains are in charge and get to dictate pretty much everything. So as the battle progresses, the captains are going to run the Confrontation in parallel with it, trying to swing the battlefield to their advantage.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Unlike a regular Confrontation, however, it is not about gaining points but about who wins or loses that round. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you win the Confrontation round, the target behaves the way you want. This represents either them being too panicked or not having enough information to make a good decision, or effective leadership and a clear grasp of what’s going on.</p><h4>WITH A CAPTAIN</h4><p style="margin:0px;">During combat, a captain can, at any time, state that they want a fighter (or group of fighters) to perform an action or behave in a certain way. </p><p style="margin:0px;">For instance, the captain might want a fighter to switch his Tactic to be more aggressive, or swap who he’s aiming for. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">He can also do this for enemy fighters: the only exception is they can’t make them run away (which can happen but we'll talk about that a bit later).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A captain can affect any number of fighters, however, they need to be easily “grouped”: there needs to be a good reason why every fighter “targeted” would be affected by the same Appeal.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Stress is given out to each person depending on the number of dice they contributed to their particular side. The winning side still halves their Stress gain.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FIELD PROMOTIONS & NO CHARISMA </strong>There might be the case a captain dies and a lieutenant is suddenly promoted, however the chain of command should have been determined beforehand.</p><p style="margin:0px;">In this case, decrement any Confrontation related dice by 1 size.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If that means the new captain has no Charisma or other skills, they’ll use their Warfare skill rounded up (so a d4! by default). So, it's better than nothing because it keeps people from just running for it and they gain less Stress but still not great.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that this can also be used in cases where uncharismatic creatures have a captain (such as a goblin leading goblins).</p><h4>A SIDE WITH NO CAPTAIN</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If one side has a captain but they're removed from combat for any reason (including going unconscious) with no replacement, everyone on their side immediately has their Panic Threshold lowered by 1 Wound Category, so keep the company captain safe!</p><p style="margin:0px;">A side with no captain can’t actively go “on the attack”, meaning that they can no longer initiate a Confrontation round but only defend against them. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If they don't have any applicable personal Confrontation Die, they auto fail and gain double the Stress the enemy captain takes.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Additionally, sides with no captains are now vulnerable to having their fighters break and run away.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RUNNING AWAY </strong>Normally, running away is only caused by a fighter reaching their Stress Threshold, but, with no captain, any Panicked fighter can be convinced to turn tail and run, inflicting any Stress it would gain on the remaining fighters.</p><h4>THE PERSONAL CONFRONTATION</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Whether or not you have a captain, individual fighters can also initiate their own, personal Confrontations with those they’re fighting.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These are typically 1 round affairs (or treated as such), and only involve the fighters’ Characteristics and any situational arguments that apply.</p><h4>ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS</h4><p style="margin:0px;">On top of that you’ll also have additional places you can pull from for your arguments that only really apply to Morale Confrontations, such as having a seasoned commander, outnumbering the opposing side, having a common Devotion to why they’re fighting and so on.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Here are common things you can draw from:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">OUTNUMBERING THE ENEMY </strong>Each side can add their total numbers to an Appeal, thus favoring the side with the most people.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CATCHING AN ENEMY BY SURPRISE </strong>This nets you a d8 until their initiative comes up.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HAVING YOU BATTLE STANDARD UP AND VISIBLE </strong>Nets you a d8.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CAUSING AN ENEMY TO PANIC </strong>Nets you a d6.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CAUSING AN ENEMY TO FLEE </strong>Nets you a d10. This can increase the amount of dice you gain from outnumbering your enemy.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">PARTY CAPTAIN’S CHARISMA </strong>You also gain your party captain’s Confrontation Dice from Charisma in this case. Also, any abilities that the Party Captain has that effect Confrontations can also be used during this Confrontation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">A PERFECT ATTACKS & DEFENSE </strong>this nets you a d6! until that person’s next Attack or Defense.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that if the argument is based on circumstance, like having an enemy Panic, it goes away when that circumstance does.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DEVOTIONS </strong>Normally, Devotions would add to your points automatically but since points don’t matter, it would make them useless in Morale Confrontations but, as we all know, why you fight does matter. If a Devotion applies to all the people being targeted that round, they add the lowest applicable Devotion to each dice. So with a Devotion of 1, if you're rolling 3d4, you'd get a +3.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Who Controls the Pool</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">It may be the case that the Party Leader, who should be responsible for the Morale Dice Pool is also your main line fighter and is already busy juggling an enemy or two.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You can have a player who runs a less combat intense character, such as the magic user or diplomat, be in charge of the Morale Dice Pool in that case and decide where to risk dice, however, only the actual Party Leader’s abilities affect the number or size of those dice applied.</p></td></tr></table><h2>Ending Combat</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Combat ends when one side is incapacitated, reached a truce, or have fled the field. At that point the Clock stops, and play moves back to narrative time. </p><p style="margin:0px;">If you engaged in a Morale Confrontation, everyone on the side that won the combat gains the difference in winning pools to their Honor, regardless of whether or not their side has less. So, if the players has 3 in their winning pool and the goblins had 7, every player still gains 4 Honor. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The losing side subtracts that with the same caveats. </p><h2>Trainings</h2><h4>CALCULATING BASELINE COMBAT ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Before we get into trainings and all that jazz, let's calculate your baseline abilities. This is from the corresponding stat as laid out in <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/2"]'>Chapter 12: Stats</a> but here is a quick summary.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> An (A) or (S) means that these abilities will be affected by your Armor and/or Shield, if you're wearing them.</p><ul><li><strong class='orangeHeader'>Attack</strong> Dex Mod + Int Mod</li><li><strong class='orangeHeader'>Defense</strong> Dex Mod + Wis Mod + A + S</li><li><strong class='orangeHeader'>Initiative</strong> Dex Mod + Wis Mod + A</li><li><strong class='orangeHeader'>Damage</strong> Str Mod</li></ul><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You'll also have Parry and Recovery, which are both based on the weapon you used but Parry may be replaced by your shield's Parry while your Recovery will be affected by your Armor. </p><h4>ARMOR BASIC TRAINING</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This basic training allows a character to more effectively utilize armor of different types based on their level of familiarity with them. It’s split into 3 categories:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LIGHT (15 CrP)</strong> This covers armor that tends to not to restrict the wearer so is often favored by skill centric characters.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MEDIUM (10 CrP)</strong> This armor is a bit heavier than Light armor and offers a tradeoff between protection and mobility.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HEAVY (10 CrP)</strong> The armor in this category is durable, thick, and heavy, able to withstand blows but at the cost of being hard to move in.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You have to buy armor training in sequence, starting at Light and moving all the way to Heavy.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can always try and use armor without the baseline knowledge of how to properly wear and don it, but the Defense penalty is doubled and you're always considered Fatigued if that’s the case.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can further your training in armor to increase the benefits. See the Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training Sidebar for more details.</p><h4>SHIELD BASIC TRAINING</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> For 10 CrP, this teaches a character the basic understanding of how to properly use and employ shields in combat. This training covers all types of shields.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can always try to use a shield without the training; however, you gain a -4 to your defense when doing so.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can further your training in shields to increase the benefits. See the Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training Sidebar for more details.</p><h4>WEAPON BASIC TRAINING</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> By gaining the basic understanding of how a weapon is wielded, used and taken care of, you not only expand its longevity, but also your longevity on the battlefield.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Weapon training costs 10 CrP and is taken for individual weapons, however its benefits extend to weapons of that share similar features.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A person completely untrained in weapons both Attacks and Defends with that weapon using a d12!. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> However, one trained uses a d20! Attack and Defense (depending on whether or not they use a shield). </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, this is extended to any weapon that shares similar qualities.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A character with training in both a Melee and Ranged weapons, gains that training to all weapons. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, why would you take training in multiple weapons once you have one melee and one ranged? Because this training allows you to further master that weapon, increasing its usefulness.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can further your training in weapons to increase the benefits. See the Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training Sidebar for more details. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Minimum Weapon Recovery</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> How fast a weapon can move and maneuver is ultimately limited by its size and balance and no matter how much you train, you can’t overcome that hurtle. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Small Melee Weapons: 2 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Medium Melee Weapons: 3 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Large Melee Weapons: 4 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Small Ranged Weapons: 3 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Medium Ranged Weapons: 4 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Large Ranged Weapons: 5 Seconds</strong></p></td></tr></table><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Trainings are further training in those particular fields, like the name implies. They can only be taken for things that you already have Basic Training in.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Each of these types of Training has two things: Tiers, which represent how broad your knowledge is (sort of like Suite Suites and Advanced Skills), and Ranks.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Every type will also have areas you can specialize in. These are the same across the Tiers of that type of Advanced Training, but you train in specific Tiers. So, Armor Advanced Training has Defense, Recovery Modifier, Fatigue, and Initiative as its areas. Each purchase in that area gives them a Rank in one of the Tiers, which is a bonus that’s applied when applicable. This bonus can't bring a negative bonus above 0, however.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The price for increasing your Rank in an area is that Tier’s Cost + twice the current Rank. </p><table style="border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td> </td><td>Rank 1</td><td>Rank 2</td><td>Rank 3</td><td>Rank 4</td><td>Rank 5</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Def</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Init</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Recovery</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Fatigue</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can’t buy up a Rank again for a given Tier until you’ve either filled out all the rest of the areas for that Tier or you have two areas in that Tier at the current highest Rank. This is true all the way down so your Advanced Training forms a weird looking triangle (as shown to the left). This is true even if you have reached the maximum benefit from an area.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tiers don't stack with each other: you gain all the bonuses from a single Tier of your choice. If you have a +1 Attack and Damage in all melee weapons and a +1 to Defense and -1 to Recovery in polearms, while wielding a pike, you either gain the +1 Attack and Damage with it or +1 Defense and -1 Recovery, but not +1 Attack, Damage, Defense, and -1 Recovery.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Bonuses cascade down through tiers but only if they’re applicable.</p><h4>COST</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Base Costs are listed next to each tier. The number in parenthesis is what Fighter Archetypes pay instead BEFORE any Improved Advanced Training Archetype Abilities they may have.</p><h4>ARMOR</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 3: All Armor (including improvised armor)</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 2: Armor Type (Light, Medium, Heavy)</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 1: Specific Armor (Gambeson, Scale, Maile, etc.)</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">AREAS</strong> Defense, Recovery Modifier, Fatigue, Initiative </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Fatigue lowers that armor's Fatigue by 1 Category for every 2 Ranks you have in it.</p><h4>SHIELDS</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 3: All Shield (including improvised shields)</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 2: Shield Size (Small, Medium, Medium)</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 1: Specific Shield (Buckler, Kite, Round, etc.)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">AREAS</strong> Defense, Parry, Fatigue, Breakage</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Fatigue lowers that shield's Fatigue by 1 Category for every 2 Ranks you have in it.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Breakage increases each Shield Breakage Threshold by 2 points for every rank obtained. So, wielding a shield with 2 ranks in this area of training means that your shield can take 19 points of damage before saving vs d20!+10, 24 before saving vs d20!, and 29 before saving vs d20!-10. This training doesn't affect weapon breakage.</p><h4>MELEE WEAPONS</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 3: All Melee Weapons (including improvised melee weapons)</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 2: Weapon Type (Sword, Polearm, Trauma, etc.)</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 1: Specific Weapon (Arming Sword, Handaxe, Mace, etc.)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">AREAS</strong> Attack, Damage, Parry, Recovery</p><h4>RANGED WEAPONS</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 3: All Ranged Weapons (including improvised ranged weapons)</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 2: Firing Type (Thrown, Mechanical, Firearm)</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 1: Specific Weapon (Sling, Longbow, Throwing Axe, etc.)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">AREAS</strong> Attack, Damage, Recovery</p><h4>UNARMED COMBAT ADVANCED TRAINING</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While you can gain Advanced Trainings in Unarmed like other weapons, because it’s not treated exactly like a weapon, you’ll have different areas in which you can become specialized in it. It is also treated as Tier 2 with costs of 12 and 10 respectively.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">AREAS </strong>Attack, Defense, Recovery, Effectiveness</p><p style="margin:0px;">Effectiveness is applied to the difference between the Attack and Defense for additional benefits ONLY if the attack hits. Every purchase adds +3 times the Tier to the total. So, Tier 3 in Effectiveness gives you a +9 to your total. </p><p style="margin:0px;">Additionally, regardless of the number of Advanced Trainings in Unarmed Combat, you’re never treated as if you have a weapon.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Ranged Weapon Firing Break Down</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you’re wondering what you’re doing at any given second when firing a ranged weapon: here’s a breakdown for you.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if you already loading and cranked (drawing) your crossbow, it would only take 5 seconds to fire it.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MISSILE RETRIEVAL </strong>This is drawing the missile from its quiver or pouch. For firearms, that means drawing out the powder and bullets.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FUSE </strong>This is the process of lighting the fuse. This can be dropped to 1 second but increases the chance of backfiring from 1 to 5.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LOADING </strong>This is knocking the arrow or loading the bullet and powder in the barrel.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAW </strong>This is drawing back the bow, cranking the crossbow, or cocking your arm for the throw. This can be prepped ahead of time for the belly- and crossbows but not the composite, long, or war bows</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">AIMING </strong>This is actually sighting your target and lining up the shot. This can be skipped, making it so you fire faster, but you roll attack on a d12! instead of the standard d20!. This can't bring a weapon below its minimum weapon Recovery.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FIRING </strong>This is pulling the trigger or loosing the arrow. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Advanced Training that lowers Recovery take from Missile Retrieval, Fuse, Loading, Drawing, and Aiming evenly but they can never reduce a single category to below 1 second. So, the minimum firing Recovery for a Composite Bow is 5 seconds. </p><table style="width:1155px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="13" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Ranged Break Down </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td></td><td>Bellybow</td><td>Composite Bow</td><td>Crossbow</td><td>Fire Lance</td><td>Hakenbuchse</td><td>Handgonne</td><td>Longbow</td><td>Sling</td><td>Warbow</td><td>Javelin</td><td>Throwing Axe</td><td>Throwing Knife</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Missile Retrieval</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Fuse</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Loading</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>18</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Draw</td><td>25</td><td>4</td><td>17</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Aim</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Firing</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Total</td><td>35</td><td>12</td><td>25</td><td>14</td><td>30</td><td>18</td><td>14</td><td>10</td><td>14</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>7</td></tr></table></table><h1>Equipment</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Now it’s time to kit out your character and get them suited up to hit the road. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Most things won’t warrant an explanation, but some have been provided for further clarification.</p><h2>Carry</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> You’ve probably noticed that Carry under your Strength Stat is just a string of numbers and letters and you probably wondered: what does that mean? Well, I’m about to tell you.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Instead of each item having a weight in pounds or ounces, each item is assigned a size that represents, not only how much it weighs, but also its general bulky and awkwardness. These sizes correspond to the naming conventions set up in <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/14"]' [queryParams]="{search: 'sizingandsizercharhear'}">Chapter 14: Misc Rules</a> however, just because something is Medium sized here, doesn’t mean it’s the size of a human - again, item sizes are based on their weights, bulkiness, and awkwardness to carry.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Your Carry matches up with that, so if you have 2M as your Carry, you can carry 2 Medium items - or 2M items.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You can also swap out 1 for 3 of the size lower. So instead of carrying 2M items, you could carry 1M item and 3S items.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each individual instance of an item counts towards this: carrying two daggers, both S items, would count as 2S for Carry.</p><h4>WEARING CLOTHES, ARMOR, & PERSONAL CONTAINERS</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Normally what is written under the Carry column for each item is its Size. The only exception is clothes, armor, and personal containers. If worn on your person, not carried or stuffed in a backpack, these become less encumbering since their weight is distributed across basically the entire body.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In this case, shrink them 1 size for Carry purposes. Small items become negligible. Wearing boots, a Small item, then makes them effectively weightless, while any Heavy Armor makes them only M.</p><h4>PERSONAL CONTAINERS</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Personal Containers, such as backpacks or sacks, go one step further. Since it is assumed that your Carry weight is how much you can hold effectively, it does take into account that some things are too awkward to effectively carry despite being fairly light.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These containers increase your Carry by the noted amount.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The exceptions, sort of, to this are coin purses, which make coins negligible (otherwise they’re 10 = 1S), quivers which do the same thing but with arrows, and scabbards and sheaths allow you to wear weapons - shrinking them 1 size.</p><h4>GOING OVER CARRY</h4><p style="margin:0px;">You can go over your Carry, of course, but it will slow you down. Going over your Carry prevents you from Sprinting.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Beyond that, each M of weight over your limit removes the next quickest Movement Category (so, removing Running, Jogging, Walking, and then Crawling) until your character is unable to move.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Unless proven otherwise, the GM should assume the characters are carrying their max Carry if they pick up something new while out adventuring.</p><h2>Currency</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The denomination of coinage is fairly simple and is done in divisions of 10.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> 10 cc = 1 silver coin (sc)</p><p style="margin:0px;"> 10 sc = 1 gold coin (gc)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> 10 gc = 1 platinum coin (pc)</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, 100 cc is equal to 1 gc.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The silver coin is the base of the economy and is what most day-to-day interactions use. If a denomination isn’t noted, it’s assumed to be sc.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Note that 100 coins is 1S</p><h2>Buying At 1st Level</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> A character starts with one of the following kits. After doing so, he rolls the kit's Extra Cash dice to determine any extra starting money to buy additional gear. When buying new items, use the Source price. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The individual sizes are notes next to the item. Note that anything with * at the end denotes that the item is worn and so the size has been adjusted accordingly. You're also given the sellback price (in sc) in case you don't want the item. For weapons, you'll notice that you're giving a generic size of weapon you can select from - the sellback price is unaffected by which weapon you would have picked up. </p><table

put: if, on a Skill Check, Attack roll (for weapons), or Defense roll (for shields and armor), you roll equal to or below the Wear of that item on the d20, that item breaks and becomes functionality unusable until it’s repaired.</p><p style="margin:0px;">There are some specific cases that should be noted:</p><p style="margin:0px;">1) You still maintain any penalties (Fatigue, Defense Modifiers from armor and shields, for example) that item gives you unless you discard it.</p><p style="margin:0px;">2) In the case of weapons, you can still use the broken weapon - you just half all the damage it does.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">3) And finally, instead of having the item break, if it’s a Superior quality item, you can instead reduce one of its Traits by 1 dice size as long as you have at least Trait at a d4!.</p><h4>REPAIRING EQUIPMENT</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Since the Maintenance Skill will only get you so far, you might need to remove Wear from your gear through blacksmithing. This is done through personally having the applicable Skill (Leather- or Metalworking, for example) or through contract work.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HIRING IT OUT</strong> If you just hand off your gear to a blacksmith, the price for repairs is 10% the base Source price for the item (not factoring in the price increase for it being Superior if that's the case) per point of Wear and takes 1 day for every 2 sc the repairs cost. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DOING IT YOURSELF</strong> If personally done through the appropriate Skill, the cost for raw materials is 5% the base Source price for the item per point of Wear with the base time being 1 day for every 4 sc, however, two things to note:</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The first is that you need to roll a Check vs d20! + the amount of Wear rounded to the next largest dice size (so, 4 Wear becomes a d6!) as the end of that time. Failure results in an amount of leftover Wear that will require twice the time and raw materials to fix at which point you'll need to make another Check. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The last thing to consider is that if you don't have a forge for metalworking, you'll have to rent one, which can range from 1cc to 1sc per day depending on how busy the forge (good luck trying to rent one at a military camp).</p><h2>Superior Equipement</h2><p style="margin:0px;">Not all equipment is built the same and, if you have some extra coin, it might benefit you to invest in some good quality gear.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Superior gear is always unique and even two +1 longswords can be different. This is done through Traits and they're like the Traits that your character has: they're used to describe the gear.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">During a Confrontation, Combat, or Challenge, if that Trait applies, you can gain an extra d4! to what is going on. This is in addition to the normal d6! for gear you get in a Confrontation and the reroll that you would normal get in a Skill Challenge.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This, however, comes at a cost: when used this way in Combat or a Skill Challenge, your gear becomes a little more worn, gaining 1 Wear.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You can have additional Traits on a single weapon and/or increase the dice size of Traits you already have. Increasing the power simply increases the size of the bonus dice you get.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Every time you do so adds an extra 50% the cost of the item.</p><h2>War Gear</h2><p style="margin:0px;">It’s generally in poor taste to walk around town or go about your daily business armed like you're going to battle. Even nobles don’t make a habit of breaking out their plate when surveying their fief as it signals a general distrust of the smallfolk.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Wearing armor heavier than light, and weapons and armor larger than small while in town or another similarly inappropriate setting docks a person 1 Honor for each infringement at the end of session.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If they enter a Confrontation with someone while they’re clearly being aggressive, the person receives an additional 4d4! per escalation to resist their charms. This applies in the case of an armed man trying to haggle with the shop keeper but not, for instance, in the case of two nobles on the battlefield meeting in the middle to exchange terms and verbal blows with one another.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This penalty can be overcome by simply storing your war equipment on your cart, horse, or arming squire.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h3 class='sidebarTitle'>Appropriate Attire</h3></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">These rules can really be applied to most situations. A character showing up to a noble’s banquet in rags is going to be just out of place as one in armor, if not more so. Players should be warned if their characters would know they’re walking into a situation where they might earn the derision of others by their attire. </p></td></tr></table><h2>Table Header Explanations </h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The following is a breakdown of how to read the following tables. Note that the prices here are not absolute and are actually the lowest price you’ll find for a give item based on the area.

These can usually be discerned by a Handle Animal Check that's, of course, appropriate to the type. So, nice try, but Handle Animal (horse) won't help you figure out which riding lizard is best.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> These stats are then used to determine the specifics of each mount: how fast can they get up and go? How long can they run for? Each of the main stats has a positive effect on some of these derived stats and a negative effect on others so figuring out the right balance for what you want out of a mount can be tricky. Averages for each breed are found under that breed's profile in the <a target="_blank" href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/">Bonfire Bestiary.</a></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You’ll note the min roll for each stat at the very top of the table for easy reference.</p><table style="width:500px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="8" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Mount, Stats </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td> </td><td>Turning</td><td>Deceleration</td><td>Acceleration</td><td>Carry</td><td>Vitality</td><td>Endurance</td><td>Bravery</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Min</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>none</td><td>none</td><td>none</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/257/gm" target="_blank">Camel, Bachrian</a></td><td>5+d4!</td><td>10+d4!</td><td>10+2d4!</td><td>40+3d6!</td><td>4d8+125</td><td>1+2d4!</td><td>-d6!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/262/gm" target="_blank">Camel, Dromedary</a></td><td>d4!</td><td>10+d4!</td><td>9+2d4!</td><td>20+2d6!</td><td>7d8!+125</td><td>2d4!</td><td>-d4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/237/gm" target="_blank">Horse, Courser</a></td><td>10-d4!</td><td>10+2d4!</td><td>10-2d4!</td><td>50+3d6!</td><td>5d8!+100</td><td>d4!-2</td><td>d4!-2</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/238/gm" target="_blank">Horse, Destrier</a></td><td>10+2d4!</td><td>10+2d6!</td><td>10-2d6!</td><td>20+3d6!</td><td>3d8!+100</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d4!-6</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/256/gm" target="_blank">Horse, Palfrey</a></td><td>7+d4!</td><td>10+2d6!</td><td>10+2d4!</td><td>20+3d6!</td><td>9d8!+100</td><td>5+d4!</td><td>2-d4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/253/gm" target="_blank">Horse, Rounsey</a></td><td>8+d4!</td><td>8+d4!</td><td>8+d4!</td><td>45+3d8!</td><td>7d8!+100</td><td>d4!+1</td><td>d4!-2</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/254/gm" target="_blank">Horse, Sumpter</a></td><td>2+d4!</td><td>6+d4!</td><td>10+2d6!</td><td>50+3d6!</td><td>7d8!+100</td><td>2d4!+1</td><td>-d4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/252/gm" target="_blank">Lizard, Pack</a></td><td>10+2d4!</td><td>6+d4!</td><td>4+d4!</td><td>85+3d10!</td><td>7d8!+75</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!-2</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/246/gm" target="_blank">Lizard, Riding</a></td><td>15+3d6!</td><td>10+d4!</td><td>4+d4!</td><td>85+3d10!</td><td>11d8!+75</td><td>3d4!</td><td>d4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td><a href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/beast/117/gm" target="_blank">Mule</a></td><td>10+2d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>10+2d4!</td><td>85+3d10!</td><td>7d8!+100</td><td>8+d4!</td><td>-2d4!</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The details of what these stats mean are expanded on in the Mounted Combat section of <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/9"]' [queryParams]="{search: 'mountedcombat'}">Chapter 9: Combat</a> but a lower Turning, Deceleration and Acceleration is good, a high Bravery is good, Carry is how many Large items they can carry (note that Small Creatures are considered a 3 Large Items, Medium are 9 Large Items, and Large are 23), and Endurance and Vitality work the same as they do in humans.</p><table style="width:500px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="6" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Animal, Barding </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Source</td><td>Local Market</td><td>Nearby Market</td><td>Distant City</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Brigandine</td>

It also determines how tough your shield is.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>DR</strong> This number is subtracted from the damage dealt by a weapon on a successful parry with a shield.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Def</strong> This is the number that you subtract from your character’s defense. Lugging a huge piece of material on the end of your arm makes dodging a bit difficult. Additionally, you’re often moving a shield into harm’s way, meaning, overall, you get hit more while wielding one.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Parry</strong> Some shields are balanced better than others and that allows you to deflect blows more effectively. This number is the shield’s Parry Threshold. This is overrides by your weapon’s Parry. Parrying with a shield subjects it to the Shield Breakage rules.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Cover</strong> This dice is added to your Defense roll against ranged weapons. If you’re actively crouching behind it, you instead add the maximum value of any dice and roll of that dice (i.e., a d8, you add d8 + 8, for d12 + d8, you add d12 + d8 + 20, etc.).</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Flanks</strong> This is the number of additional attackers from the side that the shield can defend against. More on that is found in <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/10"]' [queryParams]='{search: "10hgUnxGAkHaoZ"}'>Chapter 10: Combat</a></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Weight</strong> This is how heavy your shield is for your Carry.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Fatigue</strong> This number adjust the Wound Category at which you become Fatigued. So a shield with Fatigue -1 means that you become Fatigued at Wounded, instead of Critical (assuming you're not wearing armor as this penalty stacks with armor's).</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Bonus</strong> Some shields have additional unique bonuses. If there is a ‘yes’ in this column, look up the shield in the following section to find out more details.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>For</strong> This is a recommendation for who would benefit most from using this type of shield. "S" stands for Specialist, meaning that if you're a primarily a shield fighter, this shield will get drastically better as you take Advanced Trainings in it but it will not serve your average person well.</p><p style="margin:0px;">"W" stands for warrior: this is a solid shield for frontline fighters who are going to be specializing in other things and only lightly dipping into Shield Advanced Trainings. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">"A" stands for anyone: these shields serve as cheap replacements for armor, and anyone can pick one of these up and get an instant benefit from the. </p><table style="width:600px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="10" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Shield Stats </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Name</td><td>Size</td><td>Dr</td><td>Def</td><td>Parry</td><td>Cover</td><td>Flanks</td><td>Fatigue</td><td>Bonus</td><td>For</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Buckler</td><td>S</td><td>3/d + 8</td><td>-2</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-1</td><td>Yes</td><td>S</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Clothe</td><td>S</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>-1</td><td> </td><td>A</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Figure Eight</td><td>M</td><td>2/d + 6</td><td>-2</td><td>8</td><td>d8!+2</td><td>3</td><td>-2</td><td>Yes</td><td>S</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Heater</td><td>L</td><td>2/d + 4</td><td>-7</td><td>15</td><td>2d8!+7</td><td>4</td><td>-3</td><td> </td><td>S</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Kite</td><td>M</td><td>2/d + 4</td><td>-2</td><td>8</td><td>d6!+2</td><td>3</td><td>-2</td><td> </td><td>W</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Light</td><td>S</td><td>3/d + 6</td><td>-1</td><td>6</td><td>d4!+1</td><td>2</td><td>-1</td><td> </td><td>W</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Pavise</td><td>L</td><td>4/d + 2</td><td>-8</td><td>0</td><td>d20!</td><td>2</td><td>-3</td><td>Yes</td><td>S</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Round</td><td>M</td><td>2/d + 8</td><td>-5</td><td>10</td><td>d6!+5</td><td>3</td><td>-2</td><td>Yes</td><td>S</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Tower</td><td>L</td><td>2/d + 1</td><td>-8</td><td>16</td><td>2d8!+8</td><td>4</td><td>-3</td><td> </td><td>A</td></tr></table><h2>Shield Bonuses</h2><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Buckler</strong> The buckler is a lightweight shield which relies more on parrying blows than outright stopping them. The buckler also has the added benefit of being rather small with almost no weight, allowing it to be worn but not used while wielding two handed weapons. You receive no bonuses when doing this, but it means that if you do switch over to a one-handed weapon, you instantly get the buckler’s bonus.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Figure Eight</strong> This shield is designed specifically for phalanx or shield wall tactics. This gives a +2 Parry and a Cover of d4 to anyone fighting on either side of you. This stacks with any Parry or Cover that they have from either their weapon or shields.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Pavise</strong> This shield is less a shield and more portable cover employed by gunners and crossbowman, rather than fighters.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> However, the Pavise can be set up using a kick stand in the back, giving anyone crouching behind it basically complete cover and allowing that person the ability to steady their weapon on it.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Round</strong> This shield was meant for hitting your opponent, trying to throw them off guard. On a natural roll of 20 on Defense or an Unarmed Strike, you delay your opponent’s next attack by 5 seconds.</p><table style="width:600px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="6" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Substances, Alchemical </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Name</td><td>Size</td><td>Source</td><td>Local Market</td><td>Nearby Market</td><td>Distant City</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Amethyst, Cut (carat)</td>

Weapons 1 size larger must be wielded with 2 hands and those 2 sizes greater must be wielded with 2 hands and the wielder gains a -2 to their Fatigue (meaning that if you would normally become Fatigued at Critical, you'd instead become Fatigued at Bloodied).</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Damage</strong> This is the damage inflicted when a successful hit is scored.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Recovery</strong> This is the number of seconds a character locked in melee must wait before attacking again with this weapon.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Dam Type</strong> This tells you whether the weapon is Slashing (S), Piercing (P), or Crushing (C).</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Parry</strong> Some weapons are balanced better than others and that allows you to deflect some blows. This is the weapon’s Parry Threshold. This is overridden by your shield’s Parry if you’re using one. A successful parry with a weapon has a DR of 2/D. Parrying with a weapon subjects it to the Shield Breakage rules.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Measure</strong> This is a measure in feet of how long a weapon is. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Bonus</strong> Some weapons have additional unique bonuses.

It is called a lot of things by different cultures: mana, magic, juju, but essentially, it’s the metaphysical power that allows people to reshape reality, which is why working with it is often called weirdshaping, or simply shaping, if you don’t want to sound pretentious.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Weird lies beneath the surface of all things, a hidden power that imbues life with those indescribable feelings. It is the reason you feel attracted to someone at first sight, are speechless when you see a beautiful view, or the reason why planets have healing properties. It is not that some things are inherently ‘magical’ or ‘non-magical’ - all things have weird that is waiting to be shaped.</p><h2>Anatomy Of A Spell</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When you shape the weird, it manifests in the Middle Realm as a spell, which is broken up into different parts or “Rudiments”, which are split into types. More details on the specifics are found under the Acquiring Rudiments section below but here’s a brief overview:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SHAPE </strong>This is the shape that the spell shows up in. This can be a circle, cone, or wall, for example.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RANGE </strong>This depends on the Shape of the spell but generally it’s the reach of the spell: how long is the cone or how far can you launch a salvo shaped spell.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ORIGIN </strong>This is where the spell comes into being: this can start as the weird-adept and emanate out, it can imminent from his touch, or it can manifest yards away from him.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EFFECT </strong>This is where the spell usually gets its name and it’s what it actually does. A spell can cause Stress, remove friction, change appearances, and so on. Effects will also list the Interval, which will talk about next, and the base Range for that spell.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Effects are also special because you can add multiple Effects (or even the same effect multiple times, thus making it more powerful) to the same spell but increasing the Drain in the same amount. If it isn’t clear how an Effect would work if Stacked with itself, there’s a Stacking section for each Effect that should clear things up.</p><h4>SHAPING A SPELL</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Each of a spell’s Rudiments will have a Drain value, which added together, is how much that spell costs to cast. A spell must have at least 1 of each Rudiment type.</p><h4>FALLOUT</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Bending reality and shaping primordial force is not an easy thing to do and nature doesn’t like it. When you first shape a spell, you take 5 Stress +5 for every Category above Critical that your Fatigue is at (10 for Wounded, 15 for Bloodied, etc.). This is a one-time cost so continuing to shape the same spell doesn't further Stress you out (as long as you don't suffer weirdburn, of course).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can mitigate this by refusing some of the power. Lowering the number of SP you receive lowers the Stress you would gain on a 1 to 1 basis.</p><h2>Weird Traditions</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Ways of shaping the Weird are split up into different “Traditions”, which with their own bent on ways the Weird can manifest. These are:</p><h4>ANIMISM </h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on the manipulation of the body, forcing it to endure beyond its normal limits and making it into a weapon.</p><h4>CALLING </h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on the Realms beyond the Middle one we’re so fond of. It involves the summoning of demons, elementals, and spirits.</p><h4>CHARM </h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This focuses on the manifestation of the Weird in its raw and primal form. This allows the Weird to interact with our world in a more physical way.</p><h4>GLAMOUR</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on the manipulation of the senses, tricking the brain into seeing what the weird-adept wants you to see.</p><h4>INVESTITURE </h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This focuses on inanimate objects and either imbuing them with power or manifesting the latent potential that is already in them.</p><h4>OCCULTISM </h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on the hidden world and opening of the third mind: the divination of knowledge and the unseen.</p><h4>SORTILEGE </h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on fate, chance, and probability: more specifically, it focuses on messing with it so that things go in your favor.</p><h2>Acquiring Rudiments</h2><p style="margin:0px;">At 1st level and as dedicated by your Archetypes, you’ll have the opportunity to acquire new Rudiments, which you can then use to shape spells. You’ll do so by picking a Rudiment table and then rolling on it. If you roll a Rudiment you already have, you may select the Rudiment on either side of it. For Effects, you roll on the Effects Rudiments table and then go to the corresponding sub-table. You may spend a CrP to reroll as per the norm, even during level up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Players that seek out the knowledge to gain a specific Rudiment during play can forgo this roll and simply gain that Rudiment, however, they can’t learn more Rudiments than their Archetype and level dictates.</p><p style="margin:0px;">At first level, it is required that you have at least 1 Rudiment from each type (so, 1 Shape Rudiment, 1 Origin Rudiment, and so on) but once that’s satisfied, they can go back.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can also purchase additional Rudiments for 15 CrP a pop.</p><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Shape Rudiments </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll (d8)</td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1 - 2</td><td>Circle</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>3</td><td>Chain</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>4</td><td>Cone</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>5</td><td>Salvo</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>6</td><td>Sphere</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>7</td><td>Ray</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>8</td><td>Wall</td></tr></table><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Range Rudiments </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll (d4)</td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Double</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>Full</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td>Half</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td>Personal</td></tr></table><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Origin Rudiments </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll (d4)</td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Aura</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>Touch</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td>Near</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td>Far</td></tr></table><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Effects Rudiments </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll (d8)</td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Animism</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>Calling</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td>Charm</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td>Glamour</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5</td><td>Investiture</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6</td><td>Occult</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>7</td><td>Sortilege</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>8</td><td>Reroll</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Roll on this the Effects RudimentsTable to determine which Effects Table to roll on.

This is an Weirdcraft Skill Check with the penalty being set by which type of magic is doing the teaching and learning.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This takes a 1d4! days of study and teaching, as well as ‘dry’ runs, after which the Check is made.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If it’s successful, the person has the basics and may gain that spell as part of their normal level up (instead of rolling a random spell) or they may learn is instantly, but this takes additional work, costing them CrP to the tune of 25 - the learner’s Int score, as they have to devote additional time to finally cementing it in memory, time that might be taking up with other things.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A failure indicates that more time and study must be taken, increasing the days of study by 1 dice size (d6! days of study for the second try, d10! for the fourth attempt and so on).</p><table style="width:490px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="7" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Spell Transfer </th></tr><tr><td colspan="7" style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;">Learning</td></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><th rowspan="0">Teaching</th></tr><tr style="background: #5c5c5c;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td> </td><td> </td><td>Wild</td><td>Sourcerous</td><td>True Naming</td><td>Vancian</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td> </td><td>Wild</td><td>-4</td><td>-2</td><td>X</td><td>-8</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td> </td><td>Sourcerous</td><td>-8</td><td>0</td><td>-12</td><td>X</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td> </td><td>True Naming</td><td>X</td><td>-6</td><td>-6</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td> </td><td>Vancian</td><td>-8</td><td>-2</td><td>-4</td><td>X</td></tr></table><h2>Shape Rudiment Descriptions</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that all shapes glow slightly with strange luminesce, alerting people where the spell is.</p><h4>CIRCLE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 2</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Circle is the most basic Shape. It extends from the Origin with a Radius equal to the Base Range of the Effect. Anyone within the Circle is affected by the spell. If it deals damage or inflicts Stress, this occurs on the Interval or if a person enters/re-enters the shape. If not cast far enough away, this could also include the weird-adept.</p><h4>CHAIN</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 0</p><p style="margin:0px;">This is the most primal Shape a spell can come in. The weird-adept casts the spell and it chooses 1 viable, random target within the Range of the Spell. After half the spell’s Interval, it then leaps to the next. Anyone hit by the spell suffers its Effects for the entire time the spell is cast.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">People may be hit multiple times, which simply counts as the spell Stacking on them, but the weird-adept may try and redirect the spell, causing it to skip over a person, but they take Stress equal to the number of times they’ve done so.</p><h4>CONE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 3</p><p style="margin:0px;">The Cone starts with its tip at the Origin and then extends in a 45-degree arch from it up to the spell’s Range. Anyone within the Cone is affected by the spell. If it deals damage or inflicts Stress, this occurs on the Interval or if a person enters/re-enters the shape.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Cone can also be moved and shifted, rotating around its Origin, moving a facing every 3 seconds.</p><h4>SALVO</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 5</p><p style="margin:0px;">The Salvo is the spell chucked up to 3 * its base Range from the spell’s Origin. It requires a ranged attack to hit (though ignoring Cover). On a miss, it follows the normal ranged miss rules. Anyone that is hit, suffers the full effects of the spell. If it deals damage or inflicts Stress, this occurs on the Interval.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">From where the Salvo's touch location is, that is where the Shape of the spell is placed. Those within the Base Range of the Effect of that Shape (even on a total miss) suffer the effects of the spell for half its Interval. </p><h4>SPHERE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 5</p><p style="margin:0px;">The spell takes on the shape of a 2 ft diameter sphere that flies around, coming into being at the spell’s Origin. While the weird-adept has complete control over the direction with only minimal effort (so it doesn’t affect what else he’s doing), it still has some limitations. The first is that it only goes 10 ft / second, no faster, no slower, and the weird-adept may only turn it 45 degrees every 3 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Anyone touched by the sphere suffers the Effects of the spell.</p><h4>RAY</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 2</p><p style="margin:0px;">The ray is a thin line of magic that extends from the spell’s Origin up the 10 times the spell’s Range. It manifests in a single instant, requiring a roll to hit, but those that it hits, suffer the full Effect of the spell, though he can only try once per second, and this does eat into the Interval.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If no one was hit and the spell is still being cast, the weird-adept can manifest another ray and try again until he hits or he decasts the spell, though he can only try once per second and this does eat into the Interval.</p><h4>WALL</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 2</p><p style="margin:0px;">The wall is a line that starts at the spell’s Origin and extends up to its Range, but also into the air and below the ground up to 50 ft. It also doesn’t have to be a straight line, weaving, twisting and turning, however, no part of it can get within 5 ft of another part. It must also be anchored to the ground. The wall cannot be moved once placed unless it has an Aura Origin.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Anyone passing through the wall is affected by the Spell. Those that are in the wall’s way when it is cast, get a defense roll vs a ranged attack to get out of the way.</p><h2>Range Rudiment Descriptions</h2><h4>DOUBLE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 1</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This makes the Range of a spell twice its Base Range.</p><h4>FULL</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 0</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This makes the Range of a spell just its Base Range.</p><h4>HALF</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 1</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This makes the Range of a spell half its Base Range.</p><h4>PERSONAL</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 2</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This makes the Range of a spell just a single individual.</p><h2>Origin Rudiment Descriptions</h2><h4>AURA</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 5</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This makes it so the Origin starts at the weird-adept (and any equipment he carries) and then extends out from them, moving as they move.</p><h4>TOUCH</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 2</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This makes it so the Origin starts at whatever the weird-adept touches and then extends from there. If the target is trying to resist being touched, the weird-adept needs to make an Unarmed attack against them: the weird-adept is considered armed.</p><h4>NEAR</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 1</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This makes the Origin of the spell from the Effect's Base Range to up to double the Effect’s Base Range. This never affects the caster.</p><h4>FAR</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DRAIN</strong> 3</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This makes the Origin of the spell from double the Effect’s Base Range to up to triple the Base Range.</p><h2>Effect Rudiment Descriptions</h2><h4>ALARM</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRADITION</strong> Occultism</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE DRAIN</strong> 1</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE RANGE</strong> Trigger 50 ft, Alarm 25 ft, modified separately</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INTERVAL</strong> 3 Hours</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EFFECT</strong> When the defined type of being enters the Shape of the spell, it triggers the alarm, alerting everyone in the alarm range. The default definition is “Anything Humanoid” but this can be modified to make it more specific once.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STACK</strong> Make the trigger condition more specific by 1 step. If two definitions contradict one another, they are both cancelled out. You can also add another trigger condition. </p><h4>ALTO SCREAM</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRADITION</strong> Glamour</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE DRAIN</strong> 1</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE RANGE</strong> 30 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INTERVAL</strong> 5 Seconds</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EFFECT</strong> A high-pitched, blood-curdling scream infects the Shape of the spell, dealing 1 Stress to everyone inside.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STACK</strong> Increase the Stress by 1.</p><h4>ANCESTRAL LORE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRADITION</strong> Occultism</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">COMPONENTS</strong> Fire, the Weird-Adept’s Blood</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE DRAIN</strong> 1</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE RANGE</strong> 15 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INTERVAL</strong> 3 Skill Check or 6 Hours, whichever comes first</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EFFECT</strong> By channeling the link in your blood, you can summon an ancestor spirit to temporarily endow you with some of their knowledge. A person within the Shape of the spell increases a Int, Wis, or Char based Skill Check by +3. Anyone within the Shape of the spell may “steal” this bonus - it is first come, first serve, regardless of what the weird-adept wishes - and it can be done after they roll.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STACK</strong> Increase the bonus by +2.</p><h4>ANIMATE CORPSE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRADITION</strong> Animism</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE DRAIN</strong> 5</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE RANGE</strong> 30 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INTERVAL</strong> 4 Hours</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EFFECT</strong> Animates, or assert control over, a corpse of a used-to-be sentient being within the Shape of the spell, and up to Medium in size, into mindless undead. To gain control over already raised undead they need to both be unintelligent and uncontrolled by another. This undead doesn’t think for itself and can only follow simple commands like “Stand here and attack anyone that comes through”. It can’t speak or even defend itself properly (being unable to employ Combat Tactics or gain any bonus from Flanking) and has no survival instincts. See the Animated Corpse entry in the Bestiary.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STACK</strong> Animate an additional corpse or a corpse 1 size larger.</p><h4>ARCANE VORTEX</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRADITION</strong> Sortilege</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE DRAIN</strong> 3</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE RANGE</strong> 50 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INTERVAL</strong> 30 seconds</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EFFECT</strong> All spells that have shapes that overlap with the Spell Vortex are changed into Spheres and are attracted to the center or edges of this spell’s shape by the most direct route. If at the edge, they simply circle the edge. Spell caught this way cannot be released until the end of their Interval.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The direction is dictated by the weird-adept and can be changed only once. For Arcane Vortexes that are Walls and Ray, the spells move to either end.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STACK</strong> The direction of spells can be changed an additional time during each Interval.</p><h4>AUGUR SECRET</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRADITION</strong> Occultism</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE DRAIN</strong> 2</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE RANGE</strong> 15 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INTERVAL</strong> 30 Seconds</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EFFECT</strong> This finds anything that is purposely hidden from others, including hidden doors or a love letter sequestered away, within the Shape of the Spell.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The weird-adept doesn’t automatically know what is hidden; they only know its exact location and general area the item takes up. The weird-adept is also unaware if the object is moved but instantly knows the object if they touch it, even if it has.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STACK</strong> 1 more detail about the object is revealed to the weird-adept. This is usually in the form of, first, who is hiding the secret, and then a one-word adjective that describes it.</p><h4>BANISH</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRADITION</strong> Calling</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE DRAIN</strong> 5</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE RANGE</strong> 10 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INTERVAL</strong> 5 Seconds</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EFFECT</strong> Everyone within the Shape of the spell is temporarily banished to the Astral Plane of existence until the spell is released. Those that are banished have a sense of what is going on in the Middle Realm, though they are unable to interact with it at all.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Called creatures, demons and elementals, are permanently banished to their home plane.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STACK</strong> Increase the Base Range by 10 ft.</p><h4>BAR PORTAL</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRADITION</strong> Investiture</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE DRAIN</strong> 1</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE RANGE</strong> 50 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INTERVAL</strong> 1 Hour</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EFFECT</strong> This spell locks and seals any door or latch in the Shape of the spell. Anyone trying to bust through needs to make a Strength check vs d20! + 3 to successfully break down the door.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STACK</strong> The portal is further strengthened, giving it an additional +3. </p><h4>BESTIAL SIGHT</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRADITION</strong> Animism</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE DRAIN</strong> 3</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE RANGE</strong> 15 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INTERVAL</strong> 30 Seconds</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EFFECT</strong> This bestows everyone in the Shape of the spell one type of special vision. This covers dark vision, infrared vision, 360 vision, or aquatic vision.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STACK</strong> Either increase the Base Range by 15 ft or you may exclude a person in the Shape of the spell.</p><h4>BIND ELEMENTAL HEART</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRADITION</strong> Calling</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE DRAIN</strong> 3</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE RANGE</strong> 20 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INTERVAL</strong> 30 seconds</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EFFECT</strong> This spell either conjures an elemental heart from its realm or binds one that has gone rogue.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Once in this realm, the elemental heart robes itself in nearby sympathetic elements, giving a form with which it can then move. Without its dead kin around, the heart becomes inert and defenseless. So, while there are Order and Chaos Elementals, neither of those two things have a physical manifestation in the Middle Realm and so they simply lay there.</p><p style="margin:0px;">A conjured elemental with a Weird of d4!. The higher the Weird, the more powerful the elemental. Stats for elementals are found in the <a target="_blank" href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/">Bonfire Bestiary.</a> </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Elementals are ‘liquid’ and can shift and change their form. Their Weird can be invested to increase their baseline stats and special abilities. How much this costs is determined by the type of heart summoned. Weird can assigned at the time of summoning but also rearranged after, though this takes 1 second per point shift</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A summoned elemental heart appears in a random location within the Shape of the spell, determined by d12 for direction (12 being where the weird-adept is facing and 6 being directly behind him) and d20 for distance, and rolls a d12 initiative dice. During this time, the elemental is getting its bearings and forming itself proper.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Elementals are intelligent creatures and will struggle to overcome their bindings. Anytime you change an elemental’s command, the elemental rolls a d8! + its Weird (and the Weird of any other elementals controlled by the weird-adept) in a one round Confrontation. If it wins, the weird-adept loses control and the elemental goes rogue, first seeking out the weird-adept to try and kill them as quickly as possible</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The weird-adept can try to cast Bind Elemental Heart again to try and regain control. If the Weird you could have summoned is greater than the rogue elemental’s Weird, you regain control... for now.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If this spell is cast in any other Shape than Circle, the elemental is forced into that shape and unless the Shape can be moved, the elemental is rooted to the spot, only able to attack people who get within their Measure of that spot.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Shapes that require a roll to hit (Salvo and Ray) and do count that as the Elemental attack and thus include the Elementals damage or special attack.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STACK</strong> Increase the summoned Weird of the Elemental by d4!.</p><h4>BIND TO THE AVERAGE</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRADITION</strong> Sortilege</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE DRAIN</strong> 2</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE RANGE</strong> 50 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INTERVAL</strong> 30 seconds</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EFFECT</strong> Any roll within the Shape of the spell moves 1 point towards the average.

This illusion hooks into the minds present but has no weight or substance to it, so anyone touching it immediately knows something is up (though touch doesn’t dismiss the illusion).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">STACK</strong> The illusion gains additional area equal to 5 ft x 5 ft.</p><h4>WALL WALK</h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRADITION</strong> Investiture</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE DRAIN</strong> 3</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BASE RANGE</strong> 10 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">INTERVAL</strong> 5 Seconds</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EFFECT</strong> This endows a wall, magical or otherwise, within the Shape of the spell to be scaled with a Climbing Check, moving up down or sideways freely, with their feet on the wall and their body out-stretched as if standing.

These are codified into Covenants, or promises they make with their servants in exchange for a portion of the Divine’s power.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Cults of that Divine typically pick one, maybe two Covenants, of their chosen Divine to focus on.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This means that priests of different cults may not get along with each other and there can even be intra-faith wars to purge heretics (those that focus on different Covenant from them).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The main bonus of Covenants is that they make Miracles within them easier to invoke. The specifics are elaborated on in the Invoking Miracles section below.</p><h4>COSMIC LINKS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Higher Planes are those that exist above the crude and primitive world and so, naturally, the Divines are linked to the events and behaviors of the celestial bodies that make their homes in the heavens.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A Cosmic Link is the specific celestial body that the Divine is associated with, and it usually gives an insight to the personality of the god. The Cosmic Link doesn’t necessarily mean your Patron is primarily the Divine of that Cosmic thing. So, a Divine associated with the moon might not be primarily a moon god, in the same way that while Venus was associated with the Morning Star, she was primarily viewed as a love goddess by the Romans. Still, your holy symbols may incorporate the moon motif commonly to represent her.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For clarification’s sake: when something says “decrease” in this section’s explanations, you go down the chart by that many steps. If it says “increase” go up, so increase will always be a bonus, and decrease will always be bad.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">COMET </strong>This is associated with fervent but fleeting powers. Whenever you invoke a Miracle, you gain two Honor Dice with a +3 but lose an additional Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">EVENING STAR </strong>The evening star is a source of strength and beauty: it's the first star to rise in the evening. When you invoke a Miracle, if you roll below the average, you gain the average instead. So, if you roll d8 and get a 3 or less, you get 4 instead.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MOON </strong>The moon is a steady force, its effects are subtle but constant. When you invoke a Miracle, if you roll two Honor Dice, keeping the highest.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MORNING STAR </strong>The morning star is the last star in the heavens before day and is a lone watcher. When you invoke a Miracle and roll the minimum amount, you don’t lose any Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SUN </strong>The sun is the lord of heaven, strong and unbending, its power unquestioned. When you invoke a Miracle and roll the max amount, you don’t lose any Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CYCLICAL </strong>Often hailing from older, more primitive times, the Cyclical deity represents earthly inevitabilities in a dichotomy, sometimes with themselves and sometimes with an opposing deity. This can be Spring and Summer, life and death, creation and destruction. They may be weak now, but they will wax unstoppable. When you invoke a Miracle, and roll under its average, your next Miracle gains a +1. This is cumulative.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you roll above its average, this bonus is then removed, and you get a -1 to your next Miracle. Again, this is cumulative and resets when you roll below.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if you have a d6! Honor Dice, and you roll a 2, the next Miracle you invoke gets a +1. That next Miracle you roll, you get a 3 for a total of 4 (because of the +1), giving you a +2 the next roll. On that roll, you roll a 5 for a total of 7 ( 5 + 2 ). The next Miracle you then invoke gets a -1.</p><h2>Favor of the Divines</h2><h4>WHAT IS FAVOR?</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Favor is a measure of your standing with a given god. It’s not an absolute measure, however, but more a measure of the chance that a Divine will answer your prayer. How far your Favor goes ranges widely based on how devoted you are to a god and how Honor you are.</p><h4>LEVELS OF DEVOTION</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There are 3 levels of commitment to a Covenant, that determine how often you get Favor and how much Favor you can have:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">UNANOINTED </strong>are the lowest level: those outside the cult and its mysteries. They gain no benefits of any kind.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ANOINTED </strong>are those that are the lay members of the faith. They gain small bonuses to their max Favor for the deity they’re devoted to. You can only be anointed to one Covenant at a time.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you have a positive Devotion to a deity, one of their cults, or one of their Covenants, you can choose to begin the game as an anointed to that deity. Otherwise, you can become Anointed during gameplay once you have that Devotion.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You can only be anointed to one deity at a time.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SERVANTS </strong>are the highest rung of the commitment ladder and serve as the officers of the cult of the god. They’re priests, abbots, hierophants, pontiffs, nazarites, hermits, etc. These are men and women that have taken vows to devote their life to the cult. In game terms, this means that these are those who have a Servant Archetype as either their Primary or Secondary Archetype.</p><h4>ACQUIRING FAVOR</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Servants turn their eyes from the earth below to higher worlds, both literally and metaphorically. In this way, they’re the keeper of the times and seasons, as well as the calendar to note the occurrence of Holy Days.</p><p style="margin:0px;">As such, players who play Servants will need to keep track of the passage of time. Doing so gives them special bonuses according to the schedule laid out below. You’ll note that it follows the Gregorian Calendar layout with holy days happening according to the Judeo-Christian traditions. The assumption that the characters will be following an in-game calendar with random Holy Days specific to their cult but we’re “translating” into the Gregorian calendar, in the same way that we assume the characters are actually speaking in their native fantasy tongues and not in English. Doing this makes it easier for players to keep track because the calendar is a familiar shape. They won’t have to track out a whole year and remember that Beltane is on the 5th of Seed’s Row. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Rules for using your own calendar and keeping all Servants relatively balanced against each other is going to be the Deluxe Rules.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Favor is unique to the Divine you’re petitioning. Gaining Favor with another Divine, means that you lose an equal amount of Favor with all others because gods are bad at sharing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DAILY SACRIFICES (EVERY DAY) </strong>These are small, daily sacrifices. These tend to cost about 1 or 2 sc, 5 to 6 points of Stress, or 1 or 2 Vitality, depending on your Divine's preferences. They can be the sacrifice of a small, sacred animal, the burning of a portion of your meal, or the lighting of incense during morning prayers. They net 1 Favor for Servants of that Divine.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SABBATIC HOLY DAY (EVERY 7 DAYS) </strong>This is a day of rest and contemplation, where the faithful are instructed to put aside the things of the world and focus on the Divine with activities related to their Covenant. There is an emphasis on ritual over practicality to emphasize this divide, so while a Divine of Battle encourages his followers to fight every day, on his sabbath he only wants them to focus on ritualistic combat and controlled bloodshed, as opposed to actual combat. Again, this is to remind his followers of the holiness of the action and by forcing his followers to stop and think about their actions, he forces them to contemplate the deeper realities of combat. The sabbath takes up 1 to 3 hours and the rest of the day can be spent at the faithful wants.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Servants who observe the sabbath of their Divine gain all Favor back, while anointed worshippers gain their Min Favor from Charisma if they roll a 4 or better on their Honor die adding one Devotion related to that Divine. Unanointed worshippers gain nothing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LUNAR HOLY DAY (4 SABBATIC HOLY DAYS) </strong>Where normal Sabbaths are days of rest, Lunar Holy Days are about sacrifices and consecration, which are thematically appropriate to the cult’s Covenant. Those observing the holy day need to stop and spend the whole day or they gain no benefit.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Servants gain all Favor back plus extra Favor equal to their Min Favor. This extra Favor is reset on the next Lunar Holy Day (which means you can’t stockpile it). The Anointed gain all Favor back, while the unanointed who celebrate gain 1 Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SOLAR HOLY DAY (EVERY 3 LUNAR HOLY DAYS) </strong>These holy days celebrate the turning of the seasons and where the other festivals can be severe, with fasting and reading and nerd stuff like that, Solar Holy Days are about feasting and letting loose a bit. The Divines demand their faithful to party all day.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Servants gain all Favor back plus extra Favor equal to a roll of their Devotion. This extra Favor is reset on the next Solar Holy Day (which means you can’t stockpile it). The anointed faithful gain their full Favor back and the unanointed gain their Min Favor from Charisma if they roll a 4 or better on their Honor die adding one Devotion related to that Divine</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">ANNUAL HOLY DAY (EVERY 4 SOLAR HOLY DAYS) </strong>The Annual Holy Day either celebrates the new year or an important event in the cult, such as the birth of their messiah or the founding of their faith. It is a 2 day affair and is often occupied by feasting, gift giving, public rituals, and other such nonsense.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Servants and Anointed followers gain all Favor back with Servants also gaining extra Favor equal to their Devotion and the Anointed followers gaining extra Favor equal to a roll of their Honor die. For Servants, this extra Favor is reset on the next Annual Holy Day (which means you can’t stockpile it). The unanointed gain 1 Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TAKING AN OATH (SPECIAL) </strong>Not a sacrifice or holy day parse, Taking an Oath is essentially getting Favor on loan from the Divines for the promise that, if you get out the bad situation you're in, you'll make a huge sacrifice to them soon after. By Taking an Oath, you gain a die worth of Favor for every 20% of treasure you gain from the adventure you promise to the Divine, should you survive.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This die is equal to their Honor dice related to the Divine you're petitioning if you're Anointed to them. The Unanointed must also promise to become Anointed in addition to the cash and goods, in which case they gain a d6! worth of Favor. This Favor can put you over your max but must be spent on a Miracle immediately. </p><p style="margin:0px;">The Divines are extremely litigious. If you don't fulfill your oath in 1 month + 1 for every Honor Category higher than Average Honor you're in, they will seek vengeance. You may no longer gain any Favor with any Divine that shares a pantheon with the one you're in and what you do have will decay, causing you to lose 1 Favor per day. Priests of the Divine will also condemn you as an oath breaker, a very serious accusation, causing you to drop 1 Honor Category per month and preventing you from increasing your Honor. Should you fall into Dishonor, you gain the Excommunicated Flaw.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CRUSADES & PILGRIMAGES (SPECIAL) </strong>There are holy places to visit and holy things to be done. Crusades and Pilgrimages are special rewards the GM can give out for furthering the Divine’s will. This can either be through an actual holy war or by waging a spiritual war of conversion. These don’t even need to be things done on purpose and can be part of the campaign. </p><p style="margin:0px;">The GM should award a roll of the crusader or pilgrim's Honor dice, allowing it to go over the Max Favor allowed, and awarding them Honor for furthering their deity’s influence in the Middle Realm. Additionally, if it was an amazing feat of faith, the GM may also increase the character’s Devotion size. </p><p style="margin:0px;">The unanointed gain no benefit from crusades and pilgrimages.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CONDEMNATION & ABSOLUTION (SPECIAL) </strong>Servants and Anointed followers are expected to hold to the Divine’s tenets more closely and so can come under condemnation for disobeying their deity. GMs may subtract Favor from Servants and Anointed followers for sins against their religion or prevent them from gaining Favor for prolonged transgressions. Servants and Anointed followers with the Religion Advanced Skill in their Covenant receive a warning before they act (having studied their religion to some extent).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Those that have transgressed must seek absolution before they gain the benefit of holy days and sacrifices again. What this means varies based on the magnitude of the sin.</p><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Maximum Favor </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Honor Cate</td><td>Max Favor</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Dishonorable</td><td>Cannot Invoke</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Low Honor</td><td>0</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Average Honor</td><td>1</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>High Honor</td><td>2</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Great Honor</td><td>3</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Anointed</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Servant</td><td>Varies</td></tr></table><h4>MAXIMUM FAVOR</h4><p style="margin:0px;">A person can only have so much Favor, with the Divines giving a little extra leeway for those of strong character. The Max Favor a person can have is limited to their Honor Category.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Anointed members increase this threshold by 1 while Servants increase their Max Favor by their level, but both cannot gain any Favor while in the Dishonorable Category, regardless of level.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Should a person drop an Honor Category, if their Favor is above their new max, it automatically drops.</p><h2>Invoking Miracles</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Now that you’ve got a nice stash of Favor, you probably want to spend it. That’s pretty simple: pray out loud for the Miracle in question. Silent prayers don’t work because no Divine is going to answer a prayer they’re not going to get credit for.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For every Favor you spend, you get another use of your Honor Dice but comes with a few differences: the first, and most major, is that you can spend it on ANYTHING - you want to run faster or jump higher? You want to heal your wounds? You want to attack slightly faster? You can with Favor, however, the effects are only temporary, of course.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The second is that you can spend to change the world around you. Every Favor you spend can change a 5 ft square area with the following restriction: it can’t directly contradict things that have already been said.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Miracles are also bound by Covenant: you can’t pray for something your Divine doesn’t have power over, so a Divine of the city can’t really help you in the mountains, for example.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But this is where being in a pantheon does help out: you can pray to another Divine in your pantheon for their blessing instead, but it requires twice as much Favor and you don’t gain the benefit of your Cosmic Link.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The other restriction is that the Miracles need to be subtle: no angels coming down from the skies to keep you from falling to your death but perhaps there’s water or a passing hay cart that catches you just in time to soften your landing. There needs to be room for doubt.</p><h4>SACRED & PROFANE SPACES</h4><p style="margin:0px;">Holy places are those areas that are closer to the God’s Realm, where the Middle Realm is weaker. There the faithful can almost feel the Divines walking around.</p><p style="margin:0px;">In a sacred space dedicated to a certain Divine, the Honor Dice you get becomes 1 size larger. It also fills the devoted with a sense of purpose, temporarily increasing their Devotion by 1 for Confrontations and, if defending the space, their Devotion applies to Morale, of course.</p><p style="margin:0px;">There are also those areas that are abhorrent to the gods. Desecrated altars, dwarven holds, and other spaces the Divine presence is absent.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These Profane spaces net Honor Dice 1 size smaller, down to a d2 for each Favor spent to the Divine space is Profane to. The unanointed are completely unable to invoke Miracles.</p><h1>Character Progression</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> A person who sets off on an adventure doesn’t return the same person as they were when they left. Trials and hardships not only hone their skill, but also who they are and what they stand for. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> In Bonfire, this change is measured by Experience (Ex), which is counted at the end of every session.</p><h2>Gaining Experience</h2><table style="width:160px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Experience to Level </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Experience Needed</td><td>Total Level</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>300</td><td>2</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>600</td><td>3</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>800</td><td>4</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1000</td><td>5</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>1200</td><td>6</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1400</td><td>7</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>1600</td><td>8</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1800</td><td>9</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2050</td><td>10</td></tr></table><table style="width:160px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">  </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Experience Needed</td><td>Total Level</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>2300</td><td>11</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2550</td><td>12</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>2800</td><td>13</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>3050</td><td>14</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3350</td><td>15</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>3700</td><td>16</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>4100</td><td>17</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4550</td><td>18</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5050</td><td>19</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>5600</td><td>20</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"> The only way to gain Experience is to move towards your Goals or help others move towards theirs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At the end of each session, if you've moved towards a Goal, whether your own or another player's, whether your character knew about it or not, you gain 25 Ex. If you moved towards additional Goals, you get a extra 10 Ex for each one you helped with. However, they only get the bonus Ex for helping another person if their goals aren't identical to yours.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, let's say that you moved towards one of your Goals and helped another person with theirs. You would get 35 Ex (25 + 10). Or let's say that there wasn't enough time to do anything on your Goal, but you managed to help two other players; you'd still get 35 Ex at the end of the session (25 for the first, 10 for the second). Or, or, if you were a real wunderkind, and moved towards your Goal AND helped the two other players, you'd get 45 Ex (25 + 10 + 10). </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There is a bonus of another 25 Ex for each member if everyone in the party has moved towards their Goals that session.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> On top of this, if a party member actually completes one of their Goals, they (and anyone else who helps them) gains an additional 10% of their current Ex as well at 5 Honor (though this only applies to the person who completed it). If multiple goals were completed, you get an additional 5% Ex but no additional Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The GM may award additional Ex for completing plot important points in the story.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You don’t receive Ex for random things, such as winning a Confrontation, Combats, or Skill Challenges. Those are more about gaining Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You gain Ex for challenging who your character is. If they gain Ex from a Combat, it is not from just defeating a random foe or just being in Combat. It could be from your character facing their fears or rival, killing a person for the first time, or learning to be a leader in a stressful situation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Those things are a means to an end, not an end in and of themselves. </p><h4>FOLLOWER EXPERIENCE</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Followers don't gain ex like normal characters: instead, getting half the ex of their boss. They get no other ex unless they're Proteges.</p><p style="margin:0px;">In this case, they’re treated like a normal PC in terms of gaining ex with the expectation that the player only needs to move towards his or one of his protege’s Goals to count towards whether or not everyone has moved towards their Goals.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Additionally, a character can give up to 50% of their earned ex from a session to their protege in forms of advice, training, and general guidance.</p><p style="margin:0px;">They do come at a cost and with a requirement. The requirement is that the candidate for protege must have a Devotion to the character. The cost is that they count as 2 followers towards your limit.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Once a follower has been declared a protege, they cannot go back to being a regular follower: they must either be killed, dismissed, or promoted to a full character.</p><h2>Leveling Up</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> Once a character has received enough Ex to total level, they must take a week to think and meditate on what they’ve learned.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> During this week, they reflect on their journey and how they’ve changed. Each day, they complete one of the steps of leveling up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This self-reflection takes a large amount of the day. If the character is interrupted by any strenuous activity, they’ve lost the day and must pick up their reflection when they can from the same point.</p><h4>SPECIALISTS & TOTAL LEVEL</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you purchase your Specialist Archetype after first level or independently of one another, your total level is going to be different than your individual Specialist level. So when you see a Specialist refer to “at first level”, it refers to its first level, not your total level.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Your total level is the levels you gained in your Generalist Archetype plus the levels you gained in your first Specialist Archetype.</p><h4>DAY 1: RECEIVE CrP</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> At the start of his reflection, a character receives a number of CrP equal to his LvL CrP from his Intellect. This behaves exactly like CrP from Character Creation and can be used to buy things at any stage or reroll everything but Vitality.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can spend these are different points over the level up process, but you can also save them up to purchase more expensive things if you don’t currently have enough CrP for what you want.</p><h4>DAY 2: INCREASE STAT SCORES</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Today you may spend CrP to improve any of your Scores as per Step 6 of <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/1"]' [queryParams]="{search: '1h6'}">Chapter 1: Character Creation.</a> </p><p style="margin:0px;"> At 3rd level and every 5 levels after that (8, 13, 18, etc.), you may increase 1 of your Stats by 1</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And at 5th level and every 5 levels after that (10, 15, 20, etc.), you increase a random Stat by 1. This is rolled on a d6, with 1 being Strength and 6 being Charisma. You may influence with your Honor or spend 15 CrP for a reroll. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> None of these options (either spending CrP or the random boosts), can bring a stat above 20. If it would, you don't recieve the bonus that level.</p><h4>DAY 3: ASSESS PERSONALITY </h4><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FLAWS</strong> A character can grow, overcoming things that used to hold her down. A character can buy off a mental or behavioral Flaw for its CrP bonus (regardless of how much you got for it). If you do so, you gain a 4d6 Trait “Overcame X” with X being the Flaw. Background Flaws that have resolved through play can also give you this Trait according to the GM's discretion.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TRAITS</strong> As a character grows, things that used to be important to them no longer are and things they never used to identify with become a part of them.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character can switch around their Traits, switching a Strong one for a Medium one, or a Medium one for a Weak one. This swaps the number of dice - not the size of those dice. So, swapping a 1d8 trait for 3d10 trait makes one 3d8 and the other 1d10.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> They may also swap out a Weak one for an entirely new one.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> After 3rd level, they may only do this swap once per level, however. Before then, you may swap your Traits around freely: after all, you may still be getting on your feet in terms of the type of character that would best fit in the group and campaign. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GOALS</strong> During this time, the character carefully turns over their aims in life and can ask themselves if this is really the path they want to travel down.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Goals may be switched out, dropped or added freely at this stage but can't total more than 3.</p><h4>DAY 4: INCREASE ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Before you begin this day, it's time to decide whether or not you want to purchase your Archetype Specializations, if you haven't already. This follows the normal rules set forth in <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/4"]' [queryParams]="{search: 'IfyoupurchasLOzKLPalkr'}">Chapter 4: Archetypes</a>. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Small note: if you're Specializing at an odd level where you get a reroll, you're going to use the new Vitality Dice to do the roll but you're still rolling against your last roll. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Once you do that, check your selected Archetypes (or new Specialist Archetype(s)) to see if they have any of their Abilities that either grow stronger (i.e., the Thug’s Precision Strike), gain additional free Skills (i.e., any of the Expert Archetype’s Skill Focuses), or gain something else for free (i.e., the Weird-Adept Archetypes gaining new Rudiments).</p><h4>DAY 5: TRAIN AND RETRAIN</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Now, it’s time to home in on what you’ve learned and any new skills you’ve acquired or hidden talents you’ve discovered during your travels.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At this stage you may spend your CrP to purchase and improve your Skills, Trainings, and Characteristics. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character may also replace old knowledge with new. He may refund one of his Trainings and Skill purchases, gaining the CrP he spend on them back to spends on something else.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After 3rd level, he may only do this once per level up for each. Before that point, he may do this freely. He can never refund free Trainings or Skills earned from his Archetypes.</p><h4>DAY 6: INCREASE VITALITY & STRESS THRESHOLD</h4><p style="margin:0px;"> Finally, it’s time to reflect on the fact that your travels have made you just a little bit tougher, a little bit better at facing what life throws at you.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> At every even level, the character gets a free reroll of their Vitality Die from their last level, taking the higher of the two rolls, however, if both rolls are under their Minimum Vitality from their Constitution, they receive that value at least.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At every odd level, they gain a free roll that’s added to their total Vitality. This is not affected by their Con’s Min Vitality and is just a straight roll. You’ll need to record it on your character sheet.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If your Primary has a “choose the higher of 2” for their Vitality die, your Vitality Dice drops to one of those dice. So, “the higher of 2d6” becomes a single d6 for subsequent levels.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Remember to recalculate your Wound Categories</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character also gets mentally tougher: at every level, the character also increases their Stress Threshold. This is based on your Primary Generalist Archetype. Experts receive +d8, Socialites & Weird-Adepts a +d6, and Fighters a +d4.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, a Knight receives a +d4 while a Ranger gets +d8</p><h4>DAY 7: ADJUST HONOR & REPUTATION</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Now the other players will have a chance to adjust your <strong style="color:#B45F06;">HONOR</strong> by silently judging the character, rating him 1 to 10 in 3 categories: Flaws, Teamwork, Respect.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">FLAWS</strong> How well has this player played their Flaws? Do they only seem to be brought up when it’s convenient but then forgotten they need to get away with something?</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Does she use her Flaws to further the story and character development or does she use them to annoy others? </p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character that leans more to the former, rather than the latter, deserves a higher score.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">TEAMWORK</strong> Does this player work well with others? Do they pull their load and put themselves on the line or do they pick fights that derail the session? Are they of top on things and help set up or are they late and spend all their time on the phone?</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Again, a character that leans more to the former, rather than the latter, deserves a higher score.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RESPECT</strong> How do you think this character is viewed by those he interacts with, by both the party’s character and NPCs? Has he kept his word (or at least, not gotten caught) or does he have a habit of backstabbing others?</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The GM should then take the scores and average them across each category and then subtract 5 from each of them. Those three modified averages are then totaled: this is how much Honor they gain or lose.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The individual scores and who gave them should be kept a secret, though the player can know how much they scored in each category to help them improve.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The GM will also adjust your <strong style="color:#B45F06;">REPUTATION</strong> and complete your Reputation sentences as she deems appropriate. She gets to add 1 point at this point, but she can also move as many existing points around as she wants. She may also change the ending to any Reputation sentences she wants.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">She may also ‘free’ them up to distribute later: so, if your character moves far away where people haven’t heard of them, you could lose your Reputation, which might be good or bad.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note to GMs: while you can complete the sentences at any time, giving the player a heads up as to where their Reputation is headed, it isn’t advised that you start putting points into the other two Reputations until the character reaches 5th level.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you’ve reached 10th level, your GM should also roll to see if you’ve attracted a follower.</p><h2>Learning Non-Standard Abilities</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Players who go out of their way to roleplay their character learning a new ability can get that ability irrespective of leveling, Archetype combination, and/or CrP spending, but only if they’ve taken some penalty for doing so (suffered for it) and only at the discretion of the GM.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The rule of thumb is that a player must have gotten in at least 2d4!+2 situations where penalties they accrued in pursuit of their new ability have come into play. So, the fighter needs to go out on 5 adventures with his higher Stress for him to gain that ability.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You can adjust this as a GM: suppose the fighter got into a combat where his weapon broke due to him not repairing it and he nearly died because of it. In that case, you can count that as more than one.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The primary purpose of this is to dissuade players who are just trying to game the system and dipping here and there for specific abilities.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">REWARDS BEYOND WONDROUS ITEMS </strong>Non-standard abilities can also be used as a reward in lieu of Wondrous Items. So, if you would give out a Relic or Occult Item, give out an ability instead, either through a divine boon or because of some talent a character has discovered they have.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">LEVELING ABILITIES </strong>You can also give out leveling abilities but, once gained, the character will need to continue to sacrifice and train to increase them: they don’t level up automatically as they don’t come naturally to them, although this can be for a lesser cost.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you don’t want to keep track of that (and I don’t blame you), you can have these abilities increase at half the rate as they normally would but still increase automatically at level up.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">MADE UP ABILITIES </strong>Maybe you can’t find an Archetype ability that matches what your player is going for. A common example that I’m sure will come up for you is ambidexterity.</p><p style="margin:0px;">In this case, use the same rules but give them that ability.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So if a character is constantly using his off-hand in combat, giving him a heavy penalty, after 2d4!+2 combats, he’s gotten the hang of it and gains ambidexterity.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">CRP DISCOUNTS FOR SKILLS & TRAININGS </strong>Beyond abilities, you can also use this to reward players by either discounting Skills and Trainings or just giving them to them. So, a character who uses a weapon they don't have Basic Training for, can get that Basic Training at a discount or for free at the next level up (or even during play).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Again, this is used to reward players who roleplay their character well and not for min-maxers to abuse so feel free to adjust these guidelines as you go for each individual player.</p><h2>Attracting Followers</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While a character may use the Recruiting skill to find hirelings at any time, after a character reaches level 10, they start having people seek them out. At that point, and at every level (or 2 for those with a Weird-Adept Archetype) level above that, the GM rolls on the Follower Attracted table found below but to give context to it, let's talk about the different types you can attract.</p><h4>FOLLOWER TYPES</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These come in three varieties:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">GROUPIES </strong>These are those that wish to swim in the wake of the big fish, primarily profiting off the other followers of the party and are often washerwoman, prostitutes, or errand boys. They don’t ask anything of the party but are happy to be hired for specialty jobs as long as they pay well.</p><p style="margin:0px;">They’re also the least loyal and they’ll never put their lives on the line for the party.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">HIRELINGS </strong>Hirelings make up the paid help. They often seek out the party directly and have a basic skill or two they can offer. The idea is that the party will help them further their craft and connections for a bit of pay. They’ll make themselves as helpful as possible - such as repairing armor and weapons for the cost of room and board.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Hirelings won’t break contracts unless the captain of the party falls into Low Honor and will be more loyal than groupies, however, they’ll only risk their lives if it’s in their contract to do so.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">RETAINERS </strong>These are those that could be full adventurers on their own but has hitched their wagon to your train in hopes of getting more. They’re there out of loyalty but they do demand a greater share of the loot due to the fact that they bring more to the table.</p><p style="margin:0px;">These are, essentially, lower-level characters that you can run.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">SIDEKICKS </strong>Sidekicks are something special. A Sidekick is a person who is completely loyal to a character. They would lay down their lives for a character. A character has a limited number of Sidekicks that he can call upon over the course of his whole lifetime.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Sidekicks are childhood friends, people who deify the character, or other such unquestionably loyal followers so you only get 1 in their entire life.</p><p style="margin:0px;">A Sidekicks is essentially a second Player Character that the player gets to run.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Any new follower can be declared by the player to be a Sidekick, having sought out the party, he is recognized as an old friend or a new friend who swears undying loyalty to the character. Additionally, a follower can be elevated to the status of a Sidekick if he or the character saves the other’s life.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Even before level 10, a character can search out his Sidekick, however, they must be old friends from his past in this case.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Only severe abuse can break the bond between the hero and his Sidekick but should this happen, the Sidekick becomes an enemy of equivalent zeal.</p><h4>ATTRACTING FOLLOWERS</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">As stated above, your GM will roll on the following table to determine what followers come find you. Note that this will also be modified by the second table based on your actions.</p><p style="margin:0px;">*If you already have/had your Sidekick, you instead attract a Retainer</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">**A natural roll of 20 means you roll two additional times, regardless of the penalty.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If a character’s maximum followers has been hit (as dedicated by their Charisma), instead, they just gain another Groupie.</p><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Follower Attracted </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll (d20)</td><td>Follower Type</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td> <-5 </td><td>Groupie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-5 - 8</td><td>Hireling</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>9 - 12</td><td>Retainer</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>13 - 14</td><td>Sidekick*</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>15 - 20</td><td>Additional Follower**</td></tr></table><table style="width:370px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Follower Attraction Modifiers </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Mod</td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-1</td><td>For each non-Groupie, non-recruited-Hireling follower you have</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>+1</td><td>Character in Average Honor</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+2</td><td>Character in High Honor</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>+3</td><td>Character in Great Honor</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-2</td><td>For each time you’ve turned away a follower previous</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-5</td><td>For each follower that left because of abuse</td></tr></table><h1>Miscellaneous Rules</h1><h2>Stat Score Damage</h2><p style="margin:0px;"> Stat Score damage occurs in several places and it’s fairly straightforward. Then why have this section, you ask? As a quick aside to keep the game moving.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The sudden change in ability is incredibly unnerving, meaning that until the person can stop, take a breath and re-adjust to their new reality (meaning the player can adjust the stats on his character sheet without breaking off Combat, a Confrontation, a Challenge or any narrative tension the GM has built up), he gets a penalty of 1 for each point lost to anything that Stat Score influences. So, a -3 to Dexterity would net a temporary -3 to Attack, and Defense, +3 to Initiative, all while reducing the Confrontation Die by 3 sizes, if applicable.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If the amount drained is more than the score, the person becomes appropriately incapacitated, but not dead, until the Stat Score damage is healed.</p><h2>Diseases & Poisons</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These rules will reference poisons, as they’re the most common use case, but they equally apply to disease.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">They have 3 dimensions to a poison: its Lethality, Speed, and Symptoms.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Poisons are handled like Confrontations, with each round happening as noted by its Speed starting at the time the poison is put into the body. Each round the poison rolls the dice associated with its Lethality. The infected person can add their Con Confrontation Die each round while other characters can add their Medicine Skill as an additional dice each round to help.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Losing a round denotes that the symptoms are getting worse. Symptoms are what the poison attacks. This could be one of the character’s Stat Scores, their Stress, their Fatigue or any combination of these choices. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If one the character’s Stat Score falls below 0, the Stat Score damage multiplied by 10 and then done to their Vitality in a single Wound that simply becomes more severe. In the case of Stress, Vitality starts to be eaten away when you reach your Stress Threshold.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Every success counts against the Lethality of the poison, removing 1 dice from it. Once all the dice have been removed, the Confrontation is over and the person begins to recover: healing Stress and Vitality as normal and healing 1 point of Stat damage per day.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There’s no germ theory in the world of Bonfire and so illnesses are seen as mysterious forces controlled by the Divines, that can be controlled and even less understood. As such, there won’t be any discussion here about how a particular disease is spread and how to avoid it. GM’s should use them as they see fit for plot purposes and have logical ways of catching it, however, should the players get really into trying to deduce the logic behind it, the GM should feel free to change the ways to catch it to throw them off.</p><h2>Falling Damage</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When your character falls, they take damage based on how far that surpasses their DR from armor, however, they can do somethings to help their decent.</p><table style="width:175px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Falling Damage </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Distance (ft)</td><td>Damage</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>&#60;5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>10</td><td>1d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>20</td><td>2d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>40</td><td>3d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>60</td><td>4d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>70</td><td>5d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>75</td><td>6d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>80</td><td>7d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>82</td><td>8d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>85</td><td>9d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>87</td><td>10d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>90</td><td>11d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+1 Ft</td><td> +1d12!</td></tr></table><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Falling Modifiers </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Distance</td><td>Action</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-5 Ft</td><td>Expecting The Fall</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>- Height</td><td>Lowering Yourself First</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-5 Ft</td><td>Soft Landing</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-15 Ft</td><td>Water Landing</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>See Skill</td><td>Acrobatics Check</td></tr></table><h2>Illumination</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> For sake of simplicity, there’s five categorizations of how much light there is in an area:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BLINDING</strong> This is like staring into the sun. It's very painful and not very pleasant.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Assuming that you cover your eyes, you'll be acting as if you're blind. Even then, a moment's exposure even temporarily results in a d10! second delay as you try to recover. If you continue to expose yourself to this level of illumination, you'll be unable to act at all and will do blind in a number of seconds equal to your Con.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">BRIGHT</strong> This is the level of light of starting into a fire or just having your eyes near it. It sucks but it probably won't do permanent damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This doesn't really affect your aim or anything like that, but it does make it difficult to focus on things, delaying any action by 1d4! seconds as you try and squint and see what you're doing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Skills Checks that require sight are also rolled on a d12! and take longer.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">NORMAL</strong> This is normal daylight and occurs no operating penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DIM-LIGHTING</strong> This the equivalent of a dark room or nighttime. There’s some visibility; the character can make out shapes and shadows but no fine details.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> In melee combat, those in dim-lighting defend and attack with a 1d12! and using ranged weapons is even more of challenge. However, if you insist, you’ll be attacking with a 1d6!.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Skills Checks that require sight are also rolled on a d12!.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, Sprinting is impossible without acquiring a Stress per second moved.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong style="color:#B45F06;">DARK</strong> This is pitch black with the character not even being able to see their hands in front of their faces. This is a dungeon after the torch goes out.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Combat becomes difficult as anyone in darkness defends and attacks with a 1d6! And ranged combat is right out, but, if you insist, you’ll be attacking with a 1d4.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Skills Checks that require sight are also rolled on a d6!.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And moving above Strolling speed is extremely nerve racking, netting a Stress per Speed Category per second. So, moving at a Run for 3 seconds gives you 9 Stress (3 for the Run for 3 seconds).</p><h2> src="../../../assets/images/lights.png" alt="the different areas of light"</h2><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are currently three sources of light. How they shed their light is noted on the left:</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The white is considered Normal, the light grey is Dimly Lit and the beyond that is Dark, assuming no other light sources are provided.</p><h2>Long-term Exhaustion</h2><table style="width:350px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="3" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Long-Term Exhaustion </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Need</td><td>Nothing</td><td>Rationing</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Food</td><td>d6! Stress, d6! Damage</td><td>1d6! halved damage, 1d6! halved Stress, rounded up</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Water</td><td>2d6! Damage</td><td>1d6! Damage</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Sleep</td><td>2d6! Stress</td><td>1d6! Stress</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your character isn’t immortal, or at least, they didn’t start out that way, and so still needs to fulfil their basic needs of food, drink, and sleep. Without those basic requirements, he may find himself a bit more lethargic or, worse case scenario, dead.</p><p style="margin:0px;">There are three things your character needs to take care of, as mentioned above: food, water, and sleep, and three levels associated with each, normal, rationing, and nothing, which related to how much you have of each.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If a person sleeps the normal amount (assumed to be 8 hours), eats a healthy amount of food, and drinks a good amount of water, they take no damage or Stress. </p><p style="margin:0px;">However, if they cut back on any of three (called rationing) or don't get any sleep, food, or water (called nothing), they take the associate damage and/or Stress as noted by the table. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This is on 1 Wound per need but does stack: having no food and water gives you 2d6! damage and d6! Stress. Additionally, a Wound doesn't heal until the associated need is returned to normal.</p><h4>SMALL & LARGE SIZED CREATURES</h4><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Obviously, a smaller creature requires less food while a larger one requires more, so Small sized creatures half each threshold while Large creatures double it.</p><h2>Sizing & Size Charts</h2><table style="width:270px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="3" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Size Chart </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Size</td><td>Creature Size Equivalent</td><td>Item Size Equivalent</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Fine (F)</td><td>An Insect</td><td>A Jewel</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Diminutive (D)</td><td>A Bird</td><td>A Ring</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Tiny (T)</td><td>An Adult Cat</td><td>An Amulet</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Small (S)</td><td>A Large Dog</td><td>A Dagger</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Medium (M)</td><td>A Human</td><td>A Gallon Barrel</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Large (L)</td><td>A Horse</td><td>100 ft of Coiled Rope</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Huge (H)</td><td>A Car</td><td>A 50 Gallon Barrel (or Small Creature)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Giant (G)</td><td>A Bus</td><td>A Human</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Enormous (E)</td><td>A House</td><td>A 100 Gallon Barrel (or Large Creature)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Colossal (C)</td><td>A City Block</td><td>A Catapult</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;">RPGs give things somewhat arbitrary sizes because things affect you differently when you're different sizes. Here’s a handy chart to allow you to ballpark the Size Category something would be in if it ever comes up. These are given in real life, non-fantasy terms to be more helpful.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Most of the time this refers to area, but you can also determine size by weight, if it's applicable. A Ghost could be considered both Medium or Tiny by the metric - go with whatever applies best in that situation.</p>    </div><script src="js/script.js"></script></body></html>
