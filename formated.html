    <p>At the end of each session, if you've moved towards a Goal, whether your own or another player's, whether your

    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThisisgivenHJBylQMyVv'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>This is given when a character solves a tricky problem or came up with a creative solution. Note, this shouldn't
        be given for good rolls unless the players want to lose Honor for bad rolls; this is about out of the box
        thinking.</p>

    <p>Did the player really role play his character? Where his decisions about what he thought gave him the best chance
        to win or was it about what his character thought would be a good idea? Note, that since players are electing
        each other, jackasses who use “that’s just what my character would do” to dick over the party won’t get rewarded
        for this much. This should be specifically linked to a character's Confrontation Characteristics.</p>

    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ForeachofthKOcXHoLnSz'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>For each of these categories, the GM can also dock Honor from a character. Did they run away, or did they

    <p>Whenever you go up an Honor Category, you gain a free use of your Honor Dice. Also, when you reach 25 Honor, you
        get one as well, even though you didn't technically go up a category. Once used, they go away but they stay with

    <p>Once you do that, check your selected Archetypes (or new Specialist Archetype(s)) to see if they have any of
        their Abilities that either grow stronger (i.e., the Thug’s Precision Strike), gain additional free Skills
        (i.e., any of the Expert Archetype’s Skill Focuses), or gain something else for free (i.e., the Weird-Adept
        Archetypes gaining new Rudiments).</p>

    <p>The rule of thumb is that a player must have gotten in at least 2d4!+2 situations where penalties they accrued in
