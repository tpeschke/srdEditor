    <p>If you’re a Generalist, and you’ve spent the CrP to Specialize as part of your training, you’re going to replace
        all your Generalist Archetype Abilities, Vitality and Stress Dice, and Primary Drawback with your new Specialist
        one. Any free purchases of Skills or anything that it says that you keep (like the Servant’s Simple Faith),
        you’re going to keep; otherwise, it’s gone. </p>

    <p>You also get +1 Ranks in the Main Skill Suite of your new Specialist (or become Trained in it if you’re not
        already).</p>
