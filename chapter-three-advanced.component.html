                <p> In the beginning, the Divines created the Painted World, in which they placed their first children.
                    The Painted
                    World was mutable and the source of all magic and there the First Children lived happily, beautify,
                    skilled, and
                    perfect in everyway.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
                <div id='3p11' class='anchorTag'></div>
                <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'3p11'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
                <p> They were the delight of all the Divines, save one: the trickster Divine, Rostam. Rostam quickly
                    grew bored of
                    the First Children and the constantly fawning they received from the Divines.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

                <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'3p12'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
                <p> And so, under the guise of creating servants for the Divines, he created the Dwarves. He made the
                    opposite of
                    the First Children - crude, mean, ugly, and incorrigible in the extreme. They caused such an uproar
                    in the
                    Higher Realm that the Divines banished them to the Nothing beyond the Gate of Heaven, where certain
                    death
                    awaited them in the embrace of non-existent nothing.</p>

                <p> The Father of the Dwarves took his people and before passing through the Gate of Heaven, slew the
                    giant Ymir,
                    who stood guard there and tossed his body into the Nothing. The All-Father and his sons jumped from
                    the Gate and
                    onto Ymir and from his bones they made the Middle Realm; the giant’s blood, the oceans and his
                    muscles, the
                    earth.</p>
            </div>

                <p> There they lived a profane life, in defiance of the Divines. With the protection of the Bones of
                    Ymir, the
                    dwarves were able to avoid the direct displeasure of the Divines and so the Divines needed to think
                    of different
                    ways to reach them in their holds.</p>
            </div>

                <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'3p15'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
                <p> They created the Bonfire, links to the Higher Realm, through which they sent the unthinking evils of
                    the world
                    through but the dwarves repulsed them.</p>
            </div>

                <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'3p16'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
                <p> And so they created their Second Children, avenging angels robed in flesh, to travel through the
                    Bonfires and
                    war with the dwarves.</p>
            </div>

                <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'3p17'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
                <p> But after centuries of war, the Second Children changed: they became obsessed with the total
                    destruction of the
                    dwarves and so they chained themselves to the Bonfires, harnessing the Divine against its wills.
                    They became the
                    orcs.</p>

                <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'3p18'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
                <p> Appalled at what their Children have become, the Divines sent their First Children to bring the orcs
                    back into
                    the fold, but the orcs rebelled, sacrificing the First Children on the Bonfires and thus was born
                    the human
                    race.</p>

                <p> Centuries have passed and the Middle Realm changes those that walk there. The First Children
                    eventually called
                    it home and became the elves.</p>

                <p> Your race effects character creation in 3 ways: Ability Score Modifiers, Gameplay Rewards, and
                    Archetype Costs. If you're new to RPGs in generally, go for a race that interests you based on the

                <p> These modify the base stats that you roll. You can use it to balance out your character's weak spots

                    Bonfire is a game built around teamwork: you'll have friends who will be good at things your

                <p> Each race is meant to encourage a certain time of play. For instance, orcs gain bonus for starting
                    things, so they reward players who are aggressive, while elves get rewarded for being careful with
                    how they engage with others. These are noted under the Racial Temperament section in their summary.

                <p> Some races can spend less time mastering things than others, freeing up time (CrP) to focus on other
                    pursuits or becoming true masters of their vocation. This is reflected in the Archetype Costs.</p>

                <p> You'll notice that some races will have Archetype Exceptions: these are based on the lore of that
                    race for the Middle Realm, the official campaign setting of Bonfire. GMs should feel free to modify
                    these prices. Actually, GMs should modify any prices to fit their setting.</p>

                <p> Well, the dwarves were not going to be beaten so easily. After all, any one could be sentenced to
                    non-existance by
                    being throwing into the endless Nothing. So, they slew the guardian, Ymir, and threw his body into
                    the Nothing and thus
                    created the Middle Realm.

                <p> The rest of dwarven history is filled with the Divine's futile attempts to scrub them from the world
                    but finally
                    as the gods began to relax and realize how much they overracted, the Dwarves soon found themselves
                    fighting amongst themselves.

                <p> Dwarves are the opposite of elves. They're short, barrel chested with thick hair growing all over
                    their bodies. This
                    hair ranges from coal black to a golden hue, depending on which hold the dwarf hails from. They also
                    always support big
                    bushy beards that are near hard as steel.

                <p> Dwarf anatomy is, thankfully, a mystery to most outsiders. All dwarves, to other races, appear human
                    and use human
                    pronouns, though in dwarvish, their are no pronouns because that's more bothersome. There is a rumor
                    that their are
                    female dwarves but that there's 0 sexual dimorphism in the species, which makes courting a very
                    careful affair, but
                    the running theory is that female dwarves are just anvils.

                <p> As stated before, dwarves are subborn. They're very rarely, however, psychopathically so.
                    More often, once they have decided something, they tend to get defencive and refuse to relent
                    unless they absolutely have to.

                <p> This makes dwarven governments and social structures very slow moving and difficult to work with
                    but, it also means that if you get a dwarf to agree with you, they will happily die on that hill.

                    understanding
                    them or aware of them: they just don't think they're worth paying attention to, in the same way that

                    Worldly power and accolades hold little appeal for them, but there is a sense of wanting to
                    be apart something greater than keeps them reaching out to the outside world.

                <p> The Elves are the first born of the Divines. Originally, the inhabitants of the Painted World,
                    the source of all
                    magic, they now inhabit the Middle Realm as mentally ethereal beings.</p>

                <p> After the corruption of the Orcs, the Divines sought another means of assailing the Dwarves in
                    their holds. They
                    turned to the First Children, the Elves.</p>

                <p> So, they marshalled the elven forces and invaded the Middle Realm.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

                <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'3p23'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
                <p> The invasion proved more fruitful than the first one. The Elves’ ethereal nature allowed them to
                    interact with
                    the Middle Realm without being corrupted by it and their corporeal bodies allowed them to wage
                    war on the
                    Dwarves on their own terms.</p>

                <p> But there were side effects of their new environment. The Elves used to be nearest of the
                    Divines, found that
                    they were less connected to their creators. With all that reality in the way, their prayers had
                    a harder time of
                    reaching the Divines.</p>

                <p> After generations, the Elves have become dispersed, their common cause mostly forgotten and
                    their heritage lost
                    to the mists of time. Some continue the war, but most of have integrated into the societies of
                    the Middle Realm
                    as artisans, scholars, and wizards.</p>

                <p> Elves are slender beings that are widely considered classically beautiful, though many find
                    their features alien
                    and off putting. They uniformly have long ears that taper to a point at the end.</p>

                <p> Their eyes are pure white, with no iris or pupil visible, this matched with their sharp teeth,
                    can give them a
                    feline turn to their face.</p>

                <p> Elves naturally survive off the ebb and flow of magic that drifts through the air of the Painted
                    World. While
                    still present in the Middle Realm, these winds are a sliver of their natural magnitude and so
                    Elves need to find
                    other sources; the main one being through the magic inherent in all living creatures. While
                    vegetables do have
                    magic in them, an Elf would have to consume 100s of pounds of lettuce each day to not die of
                    starvation. The
                    only realistic way of getting enough magic to survive is through the consumption of raw meat.

                <p> To describe an Elf as “unattached” would be a huge understatement. They walk among battlefields,
                    with arrows
                    flying about them, completely unaffected. While the Orcs slaughter their companions, they will
                    calmly continue
                    picking that lock.</p>

                <p> It’s not that they don’t logically understand the dangers, but they’re rather disconnected from

                <p> However, once settled in, Stress is hard for them to adapt to. Stress is not a native feeling
                    for an Elf and so
                    when it starts to affect them they don’t have the tools to effectively deal with it, meaning
                    that reality
                    weights heavy on them.</p>

                <p> Golems are the children of the ancient symbolists of the lost dwarven. They were built
                    to serve and to work unceasingly. Through the use of the Chem in their forehead, their owners
                    could control them. They were mainly used for physical labor or work that was unsanitary in nature,
                    so golems are often uncovered centuries later, mucking out the sewers of the more grand ancient
                    cities.</p>

                    to have
                    and so many were found as ancient messengers or as body guards for the great Low Kings. Many, even
                    those
                    serving in lowly positions, are works of art, with delicate scroll work and careful attention paid
                    to the face.
                    Many will have decorations covering their body and no two golems look alike.

                <p> The golden age of golem creation, however, was lost with the rise of the First Empire,
                    which cut off dwarven control of the few Bonfires they had. All those that remain are all those

                <p> In the chaos of the fall of the First Empire, golems arose reborn, their

                    This causes a huge social upheaval in both the Orthodox faith and the remaining holds. These are
                    tools and many of the free
                    golems were smashed in protest. But like changelings, society will always find a place for those it
                    finds useful and golems,
                    in many places, have found protections that afford them some level of safety.</p>

                <p> Golems are large humanoid beings, standing, on average, about 8 ft tall. They look like large, kind
                    of
                    thick humans, with eyes, ears, and mouth. Their "skin", or outer castings,
                    is harden fired clay. This is often decorated in careful scroll work, inlaid, and/or painted.

                    anima
                    and it allows the golem to heal like any other creatures, to move and act.

                    on what their duties would be but many are left as blank slates, some without the ability to speak.

                    races. They take pride in doing things well and to do so you need to take time to mastery and learn.
                    In fact, they consider learning a sublime gift after being stuck in mental stasis for centuries and
                    take it very seriously. They're not fast learners but they are determined learners.

                <p> During the last days of the Old Vyatichi Kingdom, those with the power sought a way to
                    cheat death and become immortal. While they didn't find the cure, they found a bandage: soul
                    shiving,
                    the process of grafting a piece of another's soul onto one's own to prolong your life.
                    The priests and shamans talked about the gift they would give those who did this: how a piece of
                    their
                    soul would travel with them to heaven after death, granting even the vilest sinner reprieve. They
                    also
                    offered a hefty pay bonus too.

                    Once the Empire took over, they outlawed the practices but it couldn't be undone, not the ritual or
                    the knowledge
                    and certain government officials also partook until it was an open secret.
                    Many became man servants or thralls to these officials, pulled by some invisible thread together.

                <p> Guants tend to dress in flamboyent clothing that is a mix and match of whatever they kind find.
                    Most say this is because they loot the clothing off of those they kill but it's more likely because
                    they just wear what they can find or because they wish to make up for their dull color palette

                <p> As stated, guants get a bad rep for being wholely without morals but that's not always the case.
                    Some have undergone the process because they need to feed thier families or out of a powerful
                    sense of devotion or religious zeal so actually guants run the spectrum of personality types:
                    they're
                    just saddled with their reputation because of an admittedly not small section of them.

                <p> What makes up the guant's personality is why he made the sacrifice to do what he did.
                    Why was so precious to him that he would make such a huge sacrifice for? That's a complicated
                    question and not easy to answer by the guant player should have their answer before play
                    begins.

                <p> Beastmen are uncivilizated creatures of an untamed nature but not Minotaurs. Through
                    the Bonfire they've formed a New Covenant with the Divines, remaking their minds in their image.
                    They were the founders of the First Empire and their legacy is still cleaved to by the kings
                    of the age.

                <p> The rise of the minotaurs trace their origin back to the Sack of Um Badr, an event that, at the time
                    only mattered to the Beja, but would have world changing consquences. Details are sketchy
                    since beastmen are barbaric and don't keep records but the story goes that using the Bonfire in the
                    city,
                    the minotaurs were able to forge a New Covenant with the Divines, granting them almost human
                    intelligence.

                <p> From there, the minotaurs organized themselves together and swept through the Rhon,
                    subjegating the tribes there, overrunning the dwarven hold and learning all that they could.
                    And like that, the First Empire was born.

                <p> Like an unstoppable tide, it conquered most of the known world - bringing all under one banner.

                <p> But it wouldn't last: minotaurs, while inspired warriors and generals, have no real strong talent

                    that
                    destablized the government. Rich merchants were soon flexing their power over officials, with wanton
                    corruption investing all levels. It was all too much and the Empire cracked and fell apart.

                <p> Ratfolk were the result of advanced Bejaian magics. After the Gothic and Capatian rebels,
                    a spirit of fear riot in the city-states that a similar uprising might quickly come so the need
                    for loyal servants inspired some of the greatest magic-users of the age to begin work on creating
                    a race of people specifically made to be amenable. Thus, the first ratfolk.
