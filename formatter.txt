|1End of Session Rewards|pA person who sets off on an adventure doesn’t return the same person as they were when they left. Trials and hardships not only hone their skill, but also who they are and what they stand for.|lIn Bonfire, this change is measured by Experience (Ex) and Honor, which are counted at the end of every session.|2Ex|pThe only way to gain Experience is to move towards your Goals or help others move towards theirs.|lAt the end of each session, if you've moved towards a Goal, whether your own or another player's, whether your character knew about it or not, you gain 25 Ex. If you moved towards additional Goals, you get a extra 10 Ex for each one you helped with. However, they only get the bonus Ex for helping another person if their goals aren't identical to yours.|pSo, let's say that you moved towards one of your Goals and helped another person with theirs. You would get 35 Ex (25 + 10). |pOr let's say that there wasn't enough time to do anything on your Goal, but you managed to help two other players; you'd still get 35 Ex at the end of the session (25 for the first, 10 for the second). |lOr, or, if you were a real wunderkind, and moved towards your Goal AND helped the two other players, you'd get 45 Ex (25 + 10 + 10).|lThere is a bonus of another 25 Ex for each member if everyone in the party has moved towards their Goals that session.|lOn top of this, if a party member actually completes one of their Goals, they (and anyone else who helps them) gains an additional 10% of their current Ex as well at 5 Honor (though this only applies to the person who completed it). If multiple goals were completed, you get an additional 5% Ex but no additional Honor.|lThe GM may award additional Ex for completing plot important points in the story.|pYou don’t receive Ex for random things, such as winning a Confrontation, Combats, or Skill Challenges. Those are more about gaining Honor.|pYou gain Ex for challenging who your character is. If they gain Ex from a Combat, it is not from just defeating a random foe or just being in Combat. It could be from your character facing their fears or rival, killing a person for the first time, or learning to be a leader in a stressful situation.|lThose things are a means to an end, not an end in and of themselves.|3Follower Experience|lFollowers don't gain ex like normal characters: instead, getting half the ex of their boss. They get no other ex unless they're Proteges.|pIn this case, they’re treated like a normal PC in terms of gaining ex with the expectation that the player only needs to move towards his or one of his protege’s Goals to count towards whether or not everyone has moved towards their Goals.|lAdditionally, a character can give up to 50% of their earned ex from a session to their protege in forms of advice, training, and general guidance.|pThey do come at a cost and with a requirement. The requirement is that the candidate for protege must have a Devotion to the character. The cost is that they count as 2 followers towards your limit.|lOnce a follower has been declared a protege, they cannot go back to being a regular follower: they must either be killed, dismissed, or promoted to a full character.|3Experience Needed to Level|lSpecialist & Total Level If you purchase your Specialist Archetype after first level or independently of one another, your total level is going to be different than your individual Specialist level. |lSo, when you see a Specialist refer to “at first level”, it refers to its first level, not your total level.|lYour total level is the levels you gained in your Generalist Archetype plus the levels you gained in your first Specialist Archetype.|lFor example, if, as a 3rd level double specialist Socialite you decide to make your Primary Archetype the Advocate Specialist Archetype, you would then be an Advocate 1/Socialite with a total level of 3. If, 5 levels later, you purchased Diplomat for your Secondary slot, you would then be an Advocate 6/Diplomat 1 with a total level of 8.|2Honor|pAt the end of each session, the players will elect each other’s characters for things they think that character deserved Honor for. It is generally poor form to elect yourself but is also reasonable if you pulled off something amazing and the rest of the group didn't seem to notice.|lThese elections need to fit into one of these three categories:|3Strength|lThis character demonstrated strength based on how their character’s culture defines strength, which could be physical prowess but could also be cunning or grifting.|3Mastery|lThis is given when a character solves a tricky problem or came up with a creative solution. Note, this shouldn't be given for good rolls unless the players want to lose Honor for bad rolls; this is about out of the box thinking.|3Courage|lWhen the chips were down, did your character give up the fight or did they really show what it means to be a hero and stare down death?|3Roleplaying|lDid the player really role play his character? Where his decisions about what he thought gave him the best chance to win or was it about what his character thought would be a good idea? Note, that since players are electing each other, jackasses who use “that’s just what my character would do” to dick over the party won’t get rewarded for this much. This should be specifically linked to a character's Confrontation Characteristics.|lFor each of these categories, the GM can also dock Honor from a character. Did they run away, or did they conveniently forget any Characteristics that would have screwed them over?|3Gaining Honor Dice|lWhenever you go up an Honor Category, you gain a free use of your Honor Dice. Also, when you reach 25 Honor, you get one as well, even though you didn't technically go up a category. Once used, they go away but they stay with your character as long as they live.|lCertain Archetype abilities may also give you them temporarily, in which case, the Archetype will note for how long you have them.|1Leveling Up|pOnce a character has received enough Ex to total level, they must take a week to think and meditate on what they’ve learned.|lDuring this week, they reflect on their journey and how they’ve changed. Each day, they complete one of the steps of leveling up.|lThis self-reflection takes a large amount of the day. If the character is interrupted by any strenuous activity, they’ve lost the day and must pick up their reflection when they can from the same point.|pFor example, If Ironfoe is on day 3 of his reflection when his battle brothers decide to do a raid on a local village 2 days away, to be able to join in, he must break off his leveling (having gained his CrP and increased his Stat Scores but not having assessed how he sees himself).|lWhen the raid is over, and he’s returned to his clan stronghold, 4 days later, he can pick up where he left off and rethink what he’s doing with his life.|2Day 1: Receive CrP|pAt the start of his reflection, a character receives a number of CrP equal to his Leveling CrP from his Intellect (see table below). This behaves exactly like CrP from Character Creation and can be used to buy things at any stage or reroll everything but Vitality.|lYou can spend these are different points over the level up process, but you can also save them up to purchase more expensive things if you don’t currently have enough CrP for what you want.|2Day 2: Increase Stats|lToday you may spend CrP to improve any of your Scores as per Step 6 of Chapter 1: Character Creation.|pAt 3rd level and every 5 levels after that (8, 13, 18, etc.), you may increase 1 of your Stats by 1|lAnd at 5th level and every 5 levels after that (10, 15, 20, etc.), you increase a random Stat by 1. This is rolled on a d6, with 1 being Strength and 6 being Charisma. You may influence with your Honor or spend 15 CrP for a reroll.|lNone of these options (either spending CrP or the random boosts), can bring a stat above 20. If it would, you don't receive the bonus that level.|2Day 3: Assess Personality|3FLAWS |pA character can grow, overcoming things that used to hold her down. |lA character can buy off a mental or behavioral Flaw for its CrP bonus (regardless of how much you got for it). If you do so, you gain a 4d6 Trait “Overcame X” with X being the Flaw. |lBackground Flaws that have resolved through play can also give you this Trait according to the GM's discretion.|3TRAITS |pAs a character grows, things that used to be important to them no longer are and things they never used to identify with become a part of them.|pA character can switch around their Traits, refunding a number of temporary “Trait Points” equal to their Int and then using them to increase other Traits.|lThese Trait Points go away at the end of this day of Training: any leftover are lost.|lYou may supplement these points with CrP.|lThey may also swap out a Weak one for an entirely new one.|lAfter 3rd level, they may only do this swap once per level, however. Before then, you may swap your Traits around freely: after all, you may still be getting on your feet in terms of the type of character that would best fit in the group and campaign.|3GOALS |pDuring this time, the character carefully turns over their aims in life and can ask themselves if this is really the path they want to travel down.|lGoals may be switched out, dropped or added freely at this stage but can't total more than 3.|2Day 4: Increase Archetype Abilities|pBefore you begin this day, it's time to decide whether or not you want to purchase your Archetype Specializations, if you haven't already. This follows the normal rules set forth in Chapter 4: Archetypes.|lOnce you do that, check your selected Archetypes (or new Specialist Archetype(s)) to see if they have any of their Abilities that either grow stronger (i.e., the Thug’s Precision Strike), gain additional free Skills (i.e., any of the Expert Archetype’s Skill Focuses), or gain something else for free (i.e., the Weird-Adept Archetypes gaining new Rudiments).|2Day 5: Train & Retrain|pNow, it’s time to home in on what you’ve learned and any new skills you’ve acquired or hidden talents you’ve discovered during your travels.|lAt this stage you may spend your CrP to purchase and improve your Skills, Trainings, and Characteristics.|pA character may also replace old knowledge with new. He may refund one of his Trainings and Skill purchases, gaining the CrP he spent on them back to spends on something else.|lAfter 3rd level, he may only do this once per level up for each. Before that point, he may do this freely. He can never refund free Trainings or Skills earned from his Archetypes.|2Day 6: Increase Vitality & Stress Threshold|lFinally, it’s time to reflect on the fact that your travels have made you just a little bit tougher, a little bit better at facing what life throws at you.|3Vitality|pAt every even level, the character gets a free reroll of their Vitality Die from their last level, taking the higher of the two rolls, however, if both rolls are under their Minimum Vitality from their Constitution, they receive that value at least.|lAt every odd level, they gain a free roll that’s added to their total Vitality. This is not affected by their Con’s Min Vitality and is just a straight roll. You’ll need to record it on your character sheet.|lIf your Primary has a “choose the higher of 2” for their Vitality die, your Vitality Dice drops to one of those dice. So, “the higher of 2d6” becomes a single d6 for subsequent levels.|lRemember to recalculate your Wound Categories.|lSmall note: if you're Specializing at an odd level where you get a reroll, you're going to use the new Vitality Dice to do the roll but you're still rolling against your last roll.|3Stress Threshold|pYour character also gets mentally tougher: at every level, the character also increases their Stress Threshold. This is based on your Primary Generalist Archetype. Experts receive +d8, Socialites & Weird-Adepts a +d6, and Fighters a +d4.|lSo, a Knight receives a +d4 while a Ranger gets +d8|2Day 7: Adjust Honor & Reputation|3Honor|lNow the other players will have a chance to adjust your Honor by silently judging the character, rating him 1 to 10 in 3 categories: Flaws, Teamwork, Respect.|pFlaws How well has this player played their Flaws? Do they only seem to be brought up when it’s convenient but then forgotten they need to get away with something?|pDoes she use her Flaws to further the story and character development, or does she use them to annoy others?|lA character that leans more to the former, rather than the latter, deserves a higher score.|pTeamwork Does this player work well with others? Do they pull their load and put themselves on the line or do they pick fights that derail the session? Are they of top on things and help set up or are they late and spend all their time on the phone?|lAgain, a character that leans more to the former, rather than the latter, deserves a higher score.|lRepect How do you think this character is viewed by those he interacts with, by both the party’s character and NPCs? Has he kept his word (or at least, not gotten caught) or does he have a habit of backstabbing others?|lCalculating the Bonus/Penalty The GM should then take the scores and average them across each category and then subtract 5 from each of them. Those three modified averages are then totaled: this is how much Honor they gain or lose.|pFor example, Claire receives scores of 5, 4, and 6 for her Flaws, 3, 5, 1 for her Teamwork, and 10, 8, 10 for Respect, giving her an average of 5 (0 after the -5) for Flaws, 3 (-2) for Teamwork, and 10 (5) for Respect.|lTotaling the modified average, she gains 3 Honor|lThe individual scores and who gave them should be kept a secret, though the player can know how much they scored in each category to help them improve.|3Reputation|pThe GM will also adjust your Reptutation and complete your Reputation sentences as she deems appropriate. She gets to add 1 point at this point, but she can also move as many existing points around as she wants. She may also change the ending to any Reputation sentences she wants.|lShe may also ‘free’ them up to distribute later: so, if your character moves far away where people haven’t heard of them, you could lose your Reputation, which might be good or bad.|lNote to GMs: while you can complete the sentences at any time, giving the player a heads up as to where their Reputation is headed, it isn’t advised that you start putting points into the other two Reputations until the character reaches 5th level.|lIf you’ve reached 10th level, your GM should also roll to see if you’ve attracted a follower.|1Learning Non-Standard Abilities|lPlayers who go out of their way to roleplay their character learning a new ability can get that ability irrespective of leveling, Archetype combination, and/or CrP spending, but only if they’ve taken some penalty for doing so (suffered for it) and only at the discretion of the GM.|pExample: the fighter is realizing that he’s finding his faith as the adventure progresses. He’s actively doing things to gain Favor but beyond that, while the rest of the characters are relaxing and healing in town, he’s off at the local temple, learning about his patron Divine.|pBecause of this, while the other players get Relaxation, he’s forfeiting that so the next couple of adventures see him with a higher average Stress (and thus closer to having a Mental Break) than the rest of the party.|pAdditionally, he sought out priests of his cult and paid them to teach him, thus sacrificing his own coin on their lessons rather than spending it on repairs, fine foods, or new gear.|lAfter a few sessions and adventures, he’s more than earned the Favored of the Divines ability that’s usually reserved for the Priest Archetype.|lThe rule of thumb is that a player must have gotten in at least 2d4!+2 situations where penalties they accrued in pursuit of their new ability have come into play. So, the fighter needs to go out on 5 adventures with his higher Stress for him to gain that ability.|pYou can adjust this as a GM: suppose the fighter got into a combat where his weapon broke due to him not repairing it and he nearly died because of it. In that case, you can count that as more than one.|lThe primary purpose of this is to dissuade players who are just trying to game the system and dipping here and there for specific abilities. This should be a reward for players who roleplay their character well and not for min-maxers who abuse the system so feel free to adjust these guidelines as you go for each individual player.|2Rewards Beyond Wondrous Items|lNon-standard abilities can also be used as a reward in lieu of Wondrous Items. So, if you would give out a Relic or Occult Item, give out an ability instead, either through a divine boon or because of some talent a character has discovered they have.|2Leveling Abilities|pYou can also give out leveling abilities but, once gained, the character will need to continue to sacrifice and train to increase them: they don’t level up automatically as they don’t come naturally to them, although this can be for a lesser cost.|lIf you don’t want to keep track of that (and I don’t blame you), you can have these abilities increase at half the rate as they normally would but still increase automatically at level up.|2Made-Up Abilities|pMaybe you can’t find an Archetype ability that matches what your player is going for. A common example that I’m sure will come up for you is ambidexterity.|lIn this case, use the same rules but give them that ability.|lSo if a character is constantly using his off-hand in combat, giving him a heavy penalty, after 2d4!+2 combats, he’s gotten the hang of it and gains ambidexterity.|2CrP Discounts for Skills & Trainings|lBeyond abilities, you can also use this to reward players by either discounting Skills and Trainings or just giving them to them. So, a character who uses a weapon they don't have Basic Training for, can get that Basic Training at a discount or for free at the next level up (or even during play).|1Followers|lWhile a character may use the Recruiting skill to find hirelings at any time, after a character reaches level 10, they start having people seek them out. At that point, and at every level (or 2 for those with a Weird-Adept Archetype) level above that, the GM rolls on the Follower Attracted table found below but to give context to it, let's talk about the different types you can attract.|2Follower Types|lThese come in three varieties:|3GROUPIES |pThese are those that wish to swim in the wake of the big fish, primarily profiting off the other followers of the party and are often washerwoman, prostitutes, or errand boys. They don’t ask anything of the party but are happy to be hired for specialty jobs as long as they pay well.|lThey’re also the least loyal and they’ll never put their lives on the line for the party.|3HIRELINGS |pHirelings make up the paid help. They often seek out the party directly and have a basic skill or two they can offer. The idea is that the party will help them further their craft and connections for a bit of pay. They’ll make themselves as helpful as possible - such as repairing armor and weapons for the cost of room and board.|lHirelings won’t break contracts unless the captain of the party falls into Low Honor and will be more loyal than groupies, however, they’ll only risk their lives if it’s in their contract to do so.|3RETAINERS |pThese are those that could be full adventurers on their own but has hitched their wagon to your train in hopes of getting more. They’re there out of loyalty but they do demand a greater share of the loot due to the fact that they bring more to the table.|lThese are, essentially, lower-level characters that you can run.|3SIDEKICKS |pSidekicks are something special. A Sidekick is a person who is completely loyal to a character. They would lay down their lives for a character. A character has a limited number of Sidekicks that he can call upon over the course of his whole lifetime.|lSidekicks are childhood friends, people who deify the character, or other such unquestionably loyal followers so you only get 1 in their entire life.|pA Sidekicks is essentially a second Player Character that the player gets to run.|pAny new follower can be declared by the player to be a Sidekick, having sought out the party, he is recognized as an old friend or a new friend who swears undying loyalty to the character. Additionally, a follower can be elevated to the status of a Sidekick if he or the character saves the other’s life.|lEven before level 10, a character can search out his Sidekick, however, they must be old friends from his past in this case.|lOnly severe abuse can break the bond between the hero and his Sidekick, but should this happen, the Sidekick becomes an enemy of equivalent zeal.|2Attracting Followers|lAs stated above, your GM will roll on the following table to determine what followers come find you. Note that this will also be modified by the second table based on your actions.|p*If you already have/had your Sidekick, you instead attract a Retainer|l**A natural roll of 20 means you roll two additional times, regardless of the penalty.|lIf a character’s maximum follower number has been hit (as dedicated by their Presence), instead, they just gain another Groupie.|
