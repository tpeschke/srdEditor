    <div id="exportContent"><h5>Character Creation</h5><h1>1. Roll Stat Scores</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character has 6 attributes that define your character physically and mentally. These are Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intellect (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha). More on details are found in <strong>Chapter 2: Stat Scores.</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"> Roll 3d6 for each of these Abilities to generate that score.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This should result in something similar to this:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Str: 13</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Dex: 7</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Con: 10</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Int: 14</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Wis: 11</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Cha: 6</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Bonfire is specifically balanced for you to roll 3d6 in order, with 10 being the average result but don't worry about feeling like you have low scores or they're not in the order you want: you'll have a chance to rearrange and modify them later.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> But even if you have objectively lower stats than the rest of the company, you'll still be able to contribute in a meaningful way in your own area of expertise because Bonfire is built as a team game so nobody is going to be good at everything.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> In Bonfire, you'll almost always be weaker than your opponent: what makes a hero is not supernatural abilities, but the simple fact that he fights longer and harder for what he believes in than other men</p><h1>2. Receive Crp</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Alright, you have your scores. Now it’s time to determine how many Creation Points (or CrP, for short) you’ll start with. These CrP will be spent on modifying your character; buying them their skills and increasing their Scores. They may also be spent on rerolls at certain steps.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Even still, you may want to switch your stats around. This may be because you have almost the right stats but you have a specific character concept in mind. For instance, using the example stats in Step 1, your party may need a diplomatic character more than a strong character. In this case, it would really help to swap Strength and Charisma.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You can freely switch around your stats as need but, in that case, you only receive 25 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If you switch only 4 of your stats, you receive 50 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If you switch 2, you receive 75 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And if you keep your stats the way they are, with no changes, you gain 100 CrPs to work with.</p><h1>3. Select Race</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character’s race will change how they interact with the world and what they’ll be good and bad at so pick carefully.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Details are found in <strong>Chapter 3: Races</strong> so go there and pick one and come back here when you’re done.</p><h1>4. Choose Your Archetypes</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character has an area of expertise represented by two Archetypes.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You choose a Primary and a Secondary Archetype and pay the price in CrP for both based on your race’s Archetype Cost section. Descriptions of the different Archetypes are found in <strong>Chapter 4: Archetypes</strong> along with more details on how to combine them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve chosen to reroll your stats and have no CrPs to work with, congratulations, you’re now in CrP debt and need to make it up by the end of Character Creation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You must select two Archetypes before going further.</p><h1>5. Record Archetype Abilities</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is more for Weird-Adept Archetypes, as they’ll head over to <strong>Chapter 11: The Weird</strong> to roll their starting spells but now is the time to record any free Skills, or Trainings you obtained free from your Archetype choice, as well as Archetype Abilities.</p><h1>6. Rolls Flaws</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> All heroes have flaws. That’s what makes them relatable and human (even if they’re an orc). Character Flaws earn you additional CrP, which is great. Flaws can also be used in social situations to further the story.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> For a list of Flaws flip to <strong>Chapter 5: Flaws.</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve gone into CrP debt and you’re not out of it by the end of this stage, you’ll need to go back and reselect your Archetypes so that you are or go back to you starting set of stats and begin Character Creation all over again with them.</p><h1>7. Adjust Stats</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Now, it is time to do the final adjustments to your stats. While not your final adjustments: you'll have a chance to increase them again level up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The price to increase a Stat is the Stat + 10. So, to get a Stat to 9 from 8, it would cost 18 CrP.</p><h1>8. Calculate Character Vitals</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Now it’s time to calculate your character’s Honor, Stress Threshold, and Vitality.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> These 3 things are important parts of the game and serve as the prime mechanics when running a Bonfire game. If you’re not familiar with them head over to <strong>Chapter 6: Character Vitals.</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This chapter will also give you an overview of the character sheet that you’ll get more acquainted with later. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve already played Bonfire before, here’s a cheat sheet for calculating those things:</p><ul><li>Honor: This is determined by your “Starting Honor” listed under your Charisma</li><li>Stress Threshold: This is your Int and Wis scores added together and then doubled.</li><li>Vitality: This is Con score + Primary Archetype’s Vitality Die + Vitality Size Modifier from race, divided into 4 Categories.</li></ul><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Don't forget that you get a bonus to your CrP from the Honor of your last character. If this is your first character, you instead get 25 CrP. Enjoy.</p><h1>9. Trainings & Skills</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Trainings and Skills are additional areas of expertise that your character has obtained above his or her race and class.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Both cost CrP. Prices and descriptions can be found at the bottom of <a [routerLink]='["../../chapter/9"]' [queryParams]='{ search : "trainingsiheader"}'>Chapter 9: Combat</a> and in <strong>Chapter 7: Skills.</strong></p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class="sidebarTitle">Out of Order Character Creation</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’re a little bit more familiar with Bonfire Character creation, these last steps (step 9, 10, and 11) can be taken in any order you’d like, even skipping back and forth between them.</p></td></tr></table><h1>10. Define Social Characteristics</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your character is more than just raw stats, skills, and abilities. At this step, you’re going to define more about who they see themselves as and how others perceive them by defining their Traits, Passions, Goals, and Devotions. Jump to <strong>Chapter 8: Social.</strong></p><h1>11. Buy Equipment</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Every character starts with a kit of gear, which has a list of per purchased starting gear as well as an extra bit of starting cash they you can spend on additional things. Proceed to <strong>Chapter 10: Equipment</strong> for a full list of available kits and gear you can pick up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You may also cash in any left-over CrP for sp at 1 CrP for 10 sc, but you don’t have to. You can save your CrP to spend later at your level up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After purchasing your equipment, adjust your Encumbrance. Don’t forget that armor and shields will also modify this.</p><h1>12. Transfer To Character Sheet</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Congratulations: you’re on the home stretch! Finish your character off by transferring your notes to a fresh character sheet, an example of which, with a break down, is found in <strong>Chapter 6: Character Vitals.</strong> You can also find a download for the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L8hQ38ZjLbn9E_CDqVb6_rKG-uG_5yGX/view">character sheet here.</a></p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class="sidebarTitle">Exploding Dice</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You’ll notice a exclamation mark (!) behind a lot of dice notations. This marks the dice as exploding, which means that should the maximum of that dice is rolled, you get to roll it again, this time with a - 1, and add what you rolled to the total.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This continues for as long as you roll the maximum dice, however, the - 1 always stays a -1 one. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, if you roll a 3d8! for damage, you get a 5, 8, 8. Since you rolled the maximum value on two of your dice, you roll those dice again, and roll an 8, and 5, giving you a subtotal of 32 ( 5 + 8 + 8 + 8 - 1 + 5 - 1 ) but since you rolled another 8, you get to roll that dice again, and you get a 1, netting you a 0 ( 1 - 1 ).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are two things you should be aware of: 1d100! explode to a 1d20!, while 1d20! explode to a d6!.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The second thing is that explosion dice don’t add additional dice to the number. So, in the example above, all that damage is only counted as having been done with 3 dice (instead of the 5 that were actually rolled).</p></td></tr></table><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class="sidebarTitle">Dice Size Hierarchy</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Bonfire plays around a lot with dice sizes, so it’s important to know what dice to grab in those cases.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Dice sizes go as follows:</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d2 → d3 → d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12 → d20</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If a d4 is exploding and drops to a d3 or lower, it stops exploding.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If the dice size increases past a d20, you’ll add an extra dice starting at a d4. Further dice sizes will increase this smaller dice. This can continue ad nauseum, but no matter how many dice there are, they’re always considered to be rolled on 1 dice.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, 3d20! + d10! is still considered 1 dice.</p></td></tr></table><h5>Stat Scores</h5><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Stat Scores represent different dimensions of your character and how good their baseline is at certain activities. These dimensions are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intellect, Wisdom, Charisma.</p><h1>Stat Checks</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> There many come a time where a Skill Check doesn’t exactly cover what needs to be tested. What skill covers trying to deadlift a boulder or remember a fact about a person? When skills fail and it’s simply a raw test of an ability, Stat Checks come into play. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Players making an unopposed ability check roll a d20 and try to get a result equal to or under their their stat score. If the check is made at 1/2 the score, they're trying to roll equal to or under their score, rounded down. Should they do so, they succeed.</p><h3>OPPOSED CHECKS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Opposed checks work almost the same. The player rolls a d20! + their relevant stat score vs an opposing d20! + any relevant modifiers (such as the boulder being really heavy or only their foes relevant stat score). The person with the higher total succeeds.</p><h1>Strength</h1><table style="width:240px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="5" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Strength </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Score</td><td>Damage</td><td>Carry</td><td>Skill</td><td>Social</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>-4</td><td>1S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>-3</td><td>2S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td>-3</td><td>1M</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td>-3</td><td>1M 1S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5</td><td>-2</td><td>1M 2S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6</td><td>-2</td><td>2M</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>7</td><td>-1</td><td>2M 1S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>8</td><td>-1</td><td>2M 2S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>9</td><td>-1</td><td>1L</td><td>1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>1L</td><td>1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>1L</td><td>1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>1L 1S</td><td>1</td><td>D4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>13</td><td>1</td><td>1L 2S</td><td>1</td><td>D4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>1L 1M</td><td>2</td><td>D6!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>15</td><td>2</td><td>1L 1M 1S</td><td>2</td><td>D6!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>1L 1M 2S</td><td>2</td><td>D8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>17</td><td>3</td><td>1L 2M</td><td>2</td><td>D8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>18</td><td>3</td><td>1L 2M 1S</td><td>2</td><td>D10!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>19</td><td>3</td><td>1L 2M 2S</td><td>3</td><td>D12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>20</td><td>4</td><td>2L</td><td>3</td><td>D20!</td></tr><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Strength (Str) represents your character’s pure brawn. How much can she lift and carry? How strong are her punches?</p><h3>DAMAGE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number is added to your damage whenever your character hits something with their fits or uses thrown ranged weapons. It’s the raw, physical force he can put into an object.</p><h3>CARRY</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number represents the number of items a character can carry in their hands before he gets more Encumbered.

Can she dodge arrows or can she execute a graceful pirouette? Dexterity is crucial for avoiding blows in combat or traps in a hallway.</p><h3>ATTACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Being graceful allows your character to take advantage of openings others can’t. This number gets added to all attack rolls your character makes.</p><h3>DEFENSE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you can move quicker than your opponent, you can often get out of harm’s way before it becomes a problem. This number gets added to all melee defense rolls your character makes.</p><h3>INITIATIVE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Another bonus of being quick on your feet is the ability to get moving quicker when manure hits the windmill. This number gets added to your initiative rolls at the beginning of combat.</p><h3>SKILL</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number represents the discount you apply to Skill costs whenever you buy a Skill with this as a listed Stat.</p><h3>SOCIAL DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sometimes your character’s dexterity can play into social situations, such as trying to seduce your opponent. This is the die that gets added to your dice pool for Social Conflicts if your Dexterity is applicable.</p><h1>Constitution</h1><table style="width:260px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="5" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Constitution </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Score</td><td>Min Vitality</td><td>Encumb.</td><td>Skill</td><td>Social</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>D4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>D4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>14</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>D6!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>15</td><td>7</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>D6!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>16</td><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>D8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>17</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>D8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>18</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>D10!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>19</td><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>D12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>20</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>D20!</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Constitution (Con) represents your character’s overall health and toughness. Can he shrug off the Dancing Death or does he succumb to a head cold? Can she take a solid blow in combat and not even blink? These are the things Constitution oversees.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Constitution is the base of your starting Vitality so don’t neglect it.</p><h3>MIN VITALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Every other level, a character gains a reroll of their Vitality Die. This number is the minimum amount that reroll can be.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, if a Fighter with 15 Constitution gets a 3 on their reroll, they add 4 to that result to get it to 7.

If you're new to RPGs in generally, go for a race that interests you based on the flavor.</p><h3>STAT SCORE MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These modify the base stats that you roll. You can use it to balance out your character's weak spots or you can use it to maximize what your character is already good it. We recommend the latter as Bonfire is a game built around teamwork: you'll have friends who will be good at things your character isn't.</p><h3>GAMEPLAY REWARDS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each race is meant to encourage a certain type of play. For instance, orcs gain bonuses for starting things, like combats or social conflicts, so they reward players who are aggressive, while elves get rewarded for being careful with how they engage with others. These are noted under the Racial Temperament section in their summary. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some races can spend less time mastering things than others, freeing up time (CrP) to focus on other pursuits or becoming true masters of their vocation. This is reflected in the Archetype Costs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You'll notice that some races will have Archetype Exceptions: these are based on the lore of that race for the Middle Realm, the official campaign setting of Bonfire. GMs should feel free to modify these prices. Actually, GMs should modify any prices to fit their setting.</p><h1>Elves</h1><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Elf Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> -2 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -4 Con</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +4 Int</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> +2 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Medium Sized</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 10</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Patient</p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 5<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 5</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Weird-Adept: 0<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 0</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 10</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Elves are the first born of the Divines. Originally, the inhabitants of the Painted World, the source of all magic, they now inhabit the Middle Realm as mentally ethereal beings.</p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Elves are slender beings that are widely considered classically beautiful, though many find their features alien and off putting. They uniformly have long ears that taper to a point at the end.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Their eyes are pure white, with no iris or pupil visible, this matched with their sharp teeth, can give them a feline turn to their face.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Elves naturally survive off the ebb and flow of magic that drifts through the air of the Painted World. While still present in the Middle Realm, these winds are a sliver of their natural magnitude and so Elves need to find other sources; the main one being through the magic inherent in all living creatures. While vegetables do have magic in them, an Elf would have to consume 100s of pounds of lettuce each day to not die of starvation. The only realistic way of getting enough magic to survive is through the consumption of raw meat. </p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> To describe an Elf as “careful” would be a huge understatement. They tend to live longer than other races, not because some supernaturally long lifespan, but because they're always careful about their actions. They see other races as brash and impetuous while they're in turn seen as slow and cowardly. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> It's not they're incapable of great emotion or quick action but elves seem to understand that with every action comes a consequence, whether that action was well meaning or not, and that this karmic force is more powerful than any other law or power. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> However, once set on a course, it is hard to dissuade an elf, for they do nothing lightly.</p><h1>Humans</h1><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Human Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Medium Sized</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 15</p><p style="margin:0px;">Increase your Honor Dice by 1 size</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Your Strong and Medium Traits start out with 1 extra dice</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">We all have our theories on what personality traits that are shared by the human race and I'm not interested in wading in on that debate so instead of having a Racial Temperament, they get special modifiers. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 0<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 0</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Weird-Adept: 0<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 0</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 0</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Humans are the first natives of the Middle Realm.

They tend to be stocky, with thick muscles and hunched shoulders.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Their hair is wiry, closer to steel wool than anything else and their eyes are completely black, with no pupils or irises, giving them an indescribable inhumanness to it.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Naturally, Orcs are scavengers, able to survive on practically anything, no matter how rotten or foul.</p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> An Orc’s whole life revolves around conflict and they tend to view the world in that way. If it doesn’t allow them to get a leg up on their enemy, why bother with it?</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The issue is that they don’t really have common sense: if it doesn’t directly relate to warfare, they don’t see the benefit.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, weapons and armor, sure, but growing food? I don’t see how it gives me the leg up. Let others do it and I’ll just raid them for theirs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Orcs aren’t that much dumber than the average person but their brains tend to overheat when thinking about complex topics.</p><h5>Archetypes</h5><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Archetypes represent your character’s background training and starting skills and there are two types of Archetypes: Generalist and Specialist.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GENERALIST ARCHETYPES </strong>represent the overall theme. For instance, Fighter Archetypes tend to be good at things related to combat. So, if you’re looking to make a combat focused character, you can look there. They are Expert, Weird-Adept, Servant, Socialite, and Fighter. You must pick two starting out.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Generalists will have a wide variety of discounts within their theme that are good for just getting straight bonuses.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SPECIALIST ARCHETYPES </strong>represent a more focused version of the Generalist Archetypes. They’re more expensive but come with additional powers. When you purchase a Specialist Archetype, it replaces the Generalist Archetype of the same time. So, for instance, if you’re in Expert, you can replace it with the Ranger or the Thief. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Once you purchase a Specialist Archetype, you are stuck with it.</p><h3>PURCHASING ARCHETYPES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You first choose a Generalist Primary and a Generalist Secondary Archetype and pay the price in CrP for both based on your race. If you’re purchasing a Specialist Archetype as well, you’ll pay an additional 20 CrP for each one you’re replacing.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You use the Vitality Die, the Skills & Trainings, and the Primary Drawback sections from the Primary, and combine both Archetype Abilities sections, though you remove 1 leveling ability from your Secondary Archetype.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Specialist Archetype completely replaces everything from the Generalist Archetype they’re replacing though it doesn’t retroactively remove bonuses or free purchases. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, a Fighter, with a d10 Vitality Die decides, at level 4 to become a Soldier with a Vitality Die of a d8. He doesn’t then reroll all his Vitality Die - from that point forward, he simply uses the d8 instead.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Non-Servant Generalists and Weird-Adept Specialist Archetypes are the only ones you can select the same Archetype for both Primary and Secondary, or double specialize. So, you can be a Fighter/Fighter or Runegalder/Runegalder but not a Cateran/Cateran or a Servant/Servant. The benefits for double specializing will be noted at the end of the Archetype.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you choose to double specialize in a Generalist Archetype and then later switch out one of your Archetypes for a Specialist, you retain that double specialist bonus until you swap out the second.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Your GM may choose to reject an Archetype combination based on the fact that the two Archetypes don’t fit together thematically. So, while a Thief/Priest (Beast Covenant) might be really powerful because of the Beast Covenant’s Shape Changing ability, if there’s not a Patron of Thieves and Animals in the campaign world, you’re out of luck.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If two characters have the same ability, unless it says otherwise, those abilities stack</p><h1>Expert</h1><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want use your wits to defeat your opponent or avoid combat altogether.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Experts are those that focus on real-world non-combat skills, as opposed to relying on the Divines, magic, or their sword arm as a source of strength. They tend to rely on Intellect and Wisdom, primarily, though there are Experts that focus on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution for more physical skills.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d8</p><h3>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Experts receive 2 Free purchases of any two different Skill Suites of their choice. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL ADEPT </strong>This character has a knack for skills.

A Thief loses 5 Honor should their profession become publicly known. </p><h1>Cateran</h1><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a fighter that flanks their opponent, keeping them from moving or engaging others in combat.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Cateran is all about flanking your opponent and keeping other fighters locked down. As such, they work best with other fighters.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d8</p><h3>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Caterans receives the free Light Armor Basic Training and 1 Weapon Basic Training.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BABY-SITTING</strong> While an individual Cateran may vary in his ability to take care of infants, they all share the ability to keep combatants locked down.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Whenever a person engaged with the Cateran tries to disengage, the Cateran gets an immediate free attack that, if it hits, deals half damage. This happens regardless of where they are on the Clock and doesn’t effect when their next attack happens. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CLOSED OPENINGS</strong> Flanking is the art of dividing people’s attention and the Cateran has perfected that art. Anyone flanked by a Cateran lowers their attack die by 1 size, regardless of who they’re attacking.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MUTIEREN</strong> A Cateran knows to move their blade to get into places their opponents wouldn't expect. If facing an enemy who's weapon has a base Parry or who is carrying a shield, the Cateran receives a +1 to Attack, +1 for every 2 levels they've obtained. This ability isn't effective against people who gained their Parry solely through training.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHADOWING</strong> By keeping close to their opponent, the Cateran can negate people’s defensive posturing. By taking 15 Stress, a Cateran can negate any bonuses an opponent gets from moving, whether that’s shifting, stepping back, or whatever and also stops their opponent from moving. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> The Cateran can do this as many times as they want but the Stress cost doubles each time they do so, though this resets once they’ve had time to destress. Also, this Stress cost is lowered by 1 for every 2 levels they’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BUM RUSH</strong> A Cateran can also use his allies to more effectively flank their opponents. When flanking from the side, you and your allies lower your target’s defense die by 1, including the dice of those using shields (though they still get a chance to Parry). This doesn’t, however, give you any benefit for attacking from directly behind.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Cateran is a group fighter and fighting alone can be unnerving for him. When engaged with enemies alone and not flanking, the Cateran is unable to use his Honor.</p><h1>Knight</h1><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a heavy armored tank that inspires others to fight hard.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Knight focuses on shield and armor, and with their larger Vitality Die, they tend to be pretty tanky.

For the duration of a combat all allies gain 1 free use of an Honor Die to share between them. They gain an additional free Honor Die for every 4 levels you’ve obtained. They can only apply 1 of these bonus Honor Dice to a single roll, though that doesn’t stop them adding Honor Dice that they got from other sources, and the Honor Dice is the size of the person’s Honor Dice that redeems it.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INHERITANCE</strong> This character may have had an extra leg up in life, allowing them the opportunity to start with better equipment than others. They gain a free weapon of their choice or a Courser mount and also gain 15 sc for each CrP cashed in at the end of Character Creation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MARTIAL TRAINING</strong> A Knight receives a free Tier 2 Armor or Shield Advanced Training for every level she’s obtained. </p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Knight is a creature of Honor and respects Honor where they find it. They may be killers but they have a code, whether articulated or not. A Knight may never use a long-ranged weapon on a foe that has greater than Average Honor.</p><h1>Soldier</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play a warrior that sticks close to the rest of the company and allows them to adapt more quickly to changing situations.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Bonfire character are not meant to stand alone and this goes double for the Soldier, who work the best with others.

On top of this, they gain 1 Weapon Basic Training for free as well.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SMALL UNIT TACTICS</strong> Soldiers work as a team. If they or anyone they’re adjacent uses a tactic that moves them (Shift, Step Back, etc.), the Soldier or their adjacent ally may also use that Tactic with no penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IMPROVED ADVANCED TRAINING</strong> Soldiers rely on others to make up for their weaknesses, as such, that gives them greater freedom to really specialize in what they’re good at. For Soldiers Tier 1 Weapon Advanced Training have a Base Cost of 6.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BUDDY SYSTEM</strong> Soldiers fight as a unit, moving and acting as one where possible. When an adjacent ally switches Tactics, the Soldier may immediately switch to that Tactic as well. On top of this, they also receive a -1 bonus to their Trauma checks, which increased by 1 for every level the soldier has obtained</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MARTIAL TRAINING</strong> A Soldier receives a free Tier 1 Weapon Advanced Training for every level he’s obtained. </p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Soldier focuses so much time drilling with his preferred weapon that he can often forget that principles with one weapon can apply to another. All Tier 3 Weapon Advanced Trainings are 2 CrP more expensive. </p><h1>Thug</h1><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play someone slips through armor and wears down their opponent so they can't fight back.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Thug is designed to hit hard and make each strike count. As such they have abilities that remove an enemy’s damage reduction and increase the chance to knock someone out.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p><h3>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Thugs receive 2 free purchase of the Streetwise Skill Suite.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thugs receive the Armor Basic Training (Light) and 1 Weapon Basic Training for free. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CRITICAL STRIKE</strong> If you deal enough damage to move your opponent into the next Wound Category, you trigger a Trauma check with the target rolling a d12!, instead of a d20.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RUN 'EM RAGGED</strong> At the beginning of combat or a Skill Challenge, the Thug gains a pool of Stress equal to 5 times his level. On a successfully hit or against any Check that's opposed by another person (even if they're unaware of him), he may subtract an amount of Stress from that pool. If he does so, he inflicts that much Stress on his target, which is healed when the person Takes a Breather.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PRECISION ATTACK</strong> The Thug is an expert at making every attack count. At first level, he lowers the DR of his opponent by 1 and an additional 1 for every other level he's obtained. For /d DR, this is subtracted from the final total. </p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Thug never really rises above his street rat origins: the Leadership, Administration, Rally, and Recruiting Advanced Skills all cost double. </p><h1>Vanguard</h1><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play someone that charges in and tries to get as many people to attack them as possible.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Vanguard is the first in the fray, usually engaging multiple enemies at the same time and trying to do as much damage as possible to soften them up for their allies to follow.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d10</p><h3>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Vanguards receive 1 free purchase of the Tactics Skill Suite.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also receive the Armor Basic Training (Medium) Training and 1 Weapon Basic Training for free. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AGAINST THEM ALL</strong> When they’re in the thick of it is when the Vanguard thrives. The Vanguard gains their Honor Dice to their Attack rolls against 1 opponent when engaged with 2 or more enemies.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IN & OUT & AROUND</strong> Knowing how to slip and out of your opponent’s guards allow the Vanguard to get in and out of a jam quickly.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> By gaining 15 Stress, the Vanguard may change their engagement zone with one opponent, without any associated penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, if they’re Threatening their opponent, they could move to Engaged or they could move themselves out to Not Engaged without giving their enemy that free attack.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, if their enemy has successfully employed the In Their Guard Tactic, the Vanguard can move them back out to simply Engaged.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> They can do this multiple times by doubling the Stress gain each time it’s used. This resets after they’ve been able to gain destress. This penalty is also reduced by 1 for every 2 levels the Vanguard has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CROWD CONTROL</strong> Surrounded by enemies, the Vanguard learns to use the crowd against themselves, forcing his enemies to get in each other’s way.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A Vanguard can use his full defense against an additional opponent if the two opponents are adjacent to each other and, should anyone try to disengage with him, he may take 5 Stress, in which case, he gains a free attack against them although this is at half damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FIRST STRIKE</strong> The Vanguard hits hard and hits first. Or at least, they try to.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> At the beginning of combat, Vanguards receive a pool of Measure equal to 1 ft + 1 per every level they’ve obtained. When they first become Engaged with an opponent, they may spend ft from that pool to temporarily increase their Measure to determine who strikes first.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, a level 6 Vanguard would have a pool of 4 ft to work with. If wielding a Stiletto (Measure 1.5 ft) and closing in to Engage with an enemy wielding a Rapier (Measure 4 ft), he could spend 3 ft of it to allow him to get his hit off first, perhaps crippling his enemy before they have change to respond. Doing so would leave him with 1 ft in his pool for the rest of combat.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After that, combat resumes as normal, so he wouldn’t be able to attack the Rapier wielder if he is being Fended Off.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Vanguards are a position of Honor and they don’t take charging into battle lightly. A Vanguard loses 1 Honor for every battle they’re not the first on either side to land a melee attack.</p><h1>Priest</h1><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want your companions to benefit from their Favor more and recieve a kick-back for doing so.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Priests focus on shaping Miracles on other people rather than themselves, making them a good support Archetype for other classes. Their Miracles vary widely based on their patron Divine.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p><h3>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Priests receives 3 purchases of the Religion (The Priest’s Covenant) Advanced Skill for free</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DIVINE COVENANT</strong> During Character Creation, a Priest selects 1 Covenant and 1 Cosmic Link, representing their deity’s sphere of influence and personality, respectively.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Covenants change which Miracles the Priest has access to while Cosmic Links change the ways you gain and spend Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHEPHERD OF THE PEOPLE</strong> If someone else prays for a Miracle within sight of the Priest, the Priest can spend his own Favor to increase the effective cost of that Miracle. This ability doesn’t work on those Anointed into other cults. He gains half, rounded down, of the Favor spent this way back.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HONOR of the DIVINES</strong> If you or someone you've spent Favor on rolls the maximum value on your Honor Die while invoking a Miracle, you gain an extra use of your Honor Die.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FAVORED of the DIVINES</strong> The Priest’s mission isn’t a selfish one, but it does have some benefits and they’re loved for their devotion to their Divines beyond others. They add their level to their Max Favor. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CATECHISM</strong> By studying the holy texts, the Priest is about to discern the will of the Divines and better understand the Higher Realms. They receive a free purchase of the Religion (Divines) Advanced Skill at first level and at every level up.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> A Priest has sworn themselves to a Higher Power and as a token of their Covenant, they must select a taboo; an action or thing they must never do, such as cut their hair or eat meat. This must be appropriate to the Divine and be approved by the GM before play begins.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double specialize in this one.</p><h1>Advocate</h1><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to be supportive in a Conflict without being the center of attention and responsibility.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While other Socialites like the limelight, the Advocate doesn’t mind playing second fiddle and in fact, thrives there. When supporting others in a Social Conflict, the Advocates gets a lot of bonuses.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d4</p><h3>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Advocates gain 1 free purchase of the Lore Skill Suite.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RETHINK AN ARGUMENT </strong>Advocates tend to be more introspective than other Socialites, which allows them to wait on an argument until they can articulate their thoughts more clearly. When making an Appeal, the Advocate can put aside a number of dice that they rolled a 1 on equal to 3 + their level.</p><p style="margin:0px;">They can later bring it back in, adding it to another round’s total with a +2 for every round that dice has sat out. This can bring the total over the dice's maximum value. If you win that round, you also put dice added this way into the winning pool, if applicable.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FLANKING POINT </strong>The Advocate can really use his unassuming nature to really hammer home a point. If multiple pieces of Evidence is presented in a round of a Conflict, and the opposition picks yours to respond to, you gain an additional point.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WALLFLOWER BLOOM </strong>The Advocate really shines when not center stage. When making an Appeal, if you roll the least amount of dice (or are tied for it) and your side wins the round, gain an additional point.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HELPER'S PORTION </strong>Sometimes the reward is just to know you've helped. When the person that started the Conflict is dividing out the Honor, if the Advocate takes the least amount, they gain 1 Honor + 1 for every 5 levels they've obtained.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Advocates can kind of lock up when they’re in the driver's seat. When they’re the only one in a Social Conflict, Evidence and Appeals give them 1 less point.</p><h1>Diplomat</h1><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play someone that bends others to their will through sheer force of personailty.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Diplomat is a strong-willed character that makes the most of emotional Appeals: learning how to use them to great effect to sway his opponents.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h3>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Diplomats receive 1 free purchase of the Streetwise Skill Suite</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CAREFUL WORDING</strong> A Diplomat has the grace and tact to be able to reword an argument in the most effective way possible. The Diplomat can spend 10 Stress to reroll all of the dice for one side when they Appeal in a Social Conflict. For his and his allies’ Characteristics, take the higher of the two results. For the enemy, take the lower of the two results.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STRONG PERSONALITY</strong> As a Diplomat grows, she becomes more confident in who she is and what she wants. At 2nd level and every other level after that, a Diplomat can increase the strength of one of their Traits by 1 dice (up to a d20) or they save them and cash in two of these increases for a new weak Trait starting at 1d4.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GREY EMINENCE</strong> In his arena, he is king and nothing can shake him. For the duration of a Conflict the Diplomat gains 1 free use of their Honor Die. They gain an additional free Honor Die for every level they’ve obtained. They can only apply 1 of these bonus Honor Dice to a single roll, though that doesn’t stop them adding Honor Dice that they got from other sources.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RESILIENT CHARACTER</strong> Surprisingly, those with the strongest personalities have the greatest power to resist abuse and not second guess themselves. When using an Appeal, shrink the Repercussion Dice by 1 size.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Diplomats put their reputation on the table whenever they engage in Social Conflict. They lose 5 Honor whenever they lose a Conflict.</p><h1>Noble</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to debuff your enemy while gaining strength through winning Appeals.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Noble is typically aloof and hard to impress and so can convince people simply by making them unsure about their conviction, shrinking their dice in Social Conflict. </p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h3>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Nobles receive 1 free purchase of the Tactics Skill Suite</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NOBLE BEARING</strong> By reminding others of their lower station in life, you can remind them just how petty their needs are. You inflict 1 point of Stress for every Characteristic your opponent(s) brings in each round up to your level, rounded up.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RETHINK YOUR WORDS</strong> Assail the throne of a noble’s grace with caution, for you are at his will and pleasure. Whenever the Noble, or one of his allies, wins an Appeal, you may force the enemy to reroll one of their dice on their next Appeal.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ROYAL BACKGROUND</strong> Nobles form an elite class of society, giving them a strong sense of self and confidence. Their Devotion to their clan starts at a 1d10! and they gain the Trait “Noble Heritage” at 3d6! for free. This doesn't replace any of their 6 free Traits and may be increased in the normal matter.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GOOD BREEDING</strong> In victory or defeat, the Noble is gracious. At the end of a Conflict, the Noble receives 1 Honor automatically. This bonus is increased by 1 Honor for every 2 levels he’s obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;">All his allies also automatically gain 1 Honor, though this doesn’t increase as the Noble levels.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INHERITANCE</strong> This character may have had an extra leg up in life, allowing them the opportunity to start with better equipment than others. They gain a free weapon of their choice or a Courser mount and also gain 15 sc for each CrP cashed in at the end of Character Creation.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Nobility is a collective illusion and so those of royal blood, no matter how limited strive to keep that illusion in place. Nobles lose 1 Honor and gain 1 Stress whenever they're not referred to by either their proper title, "my lord", or "sir". </p><h1>Rascal</h1><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to play some that relies more on the circumstances of the Conflict than on their raw stats.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Rascal gains a few skills but their main strength is their cunning ability to avert danger, though any brush with death leaves him shaken. On top of this, in Social Conflict, the Rascal wins because he can leverage circumstances in his favor.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p><h3>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Rascals receive 1 free purchase of the Trades Skill Suite</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LUCKY </strong> The Rascal is naturally blessed with the ability to get out of trouble and use that adrenaline that comes as death comes near to dodge the grim reaper and keep running. After the results are given, the Rascal can take 2 Stress to modify his results by 1. These may be done with the following conditions:</p><ul><li>They can never be used to make you a better fighter. Stress gained this way can only be used to dodge death or escape a bad situation but never to make your character a superman. </li><li>The character must think of a situation that saves his rear end, something that happens to him that’s to his advantage. </li></ul><p style="margin:0px;">The key here is that it can’t be impossible but it can be highly improbable. The chandelier rope breaking right at that moment separating him from a blood thirsty guard, a pigeon flying across an archer’s view intercepting an arrow, etc. are all acceptable.</p><p style="margin:0px;">It can’t be the result of skill. Him deflecting the blade with his hand like a badass is right out.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Should the character be unable to think of a scenario that fits both of these criteria, he’s unable to gain Stress to save himself.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GREASE PAINT & GLITTER</strong> If there's one thing that a Rascal knows, it’s how to position themselves in the most advantageous light. In a Conflict, once per round, the Rascal increases one dice 1 size. This is increased to by 1 for every level he’s obtained. This can either be his or his allies’, it doesn’t matter.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Once he’s increased all dice in a round 1 size, he may then go back and increase them again, and so on.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Any, 2)</strong> At first level and every level other up, Rascals receive 2 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skill. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Rascal favors no weapons as they tend to get you killed: all Weapon Advanced Trainings are 2 CrP more expensive per Tier (Tier 1: 11 CrP, Tier 2: 16 CrP, Tier 3: 22 CrP).</p><h1>Runegalder</h1><p style="margin:0px;">Choose this Archetype if you want to player a weird-adept and are familiar with other games' spellcasters.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Unlike other magic-users, the Runegalder seals magical power in his bond, allowing him to not risk his body when working with supernatural forces. This allows him to cast quickly and consistently but limits the amount and flexibility of his spells.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p><h3>SKILLS & TRAININGS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Runegalders receive 1 free purchase of the Lore Skill Suite as well as an additional free purchase of Literacy in their native language and the Weirdcraft Skill Suites.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>VANCIAN SHAPING</strong> The Runegalder chains the power of spells to various runes that he then invests, sealing them with his blood until he’s ready to release them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Every 24 hours, the Runegalder can seal 3 spells. He can also bind an additional spell for every 3 levels he’s obtained. This means that he may cast those spells at any time by simply speaking the rune they’re linked to, once prepared. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Speaking the rune releases it from its binding so speaking the same rune again before he’s resealed it will not recast the spell - the spell’s power is gone. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> He may cast a spell multiple times per day but he’ll need to bind each instance of the spell to a different rune. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Speaking a rune in this way doesn’t affect the Runegalder and so he ignores Fallout to himself.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> He may also unseal a rune without actually shaping it but he is not able to immediately reseal a new rune right after.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GRIMOIRE</strong> This is the Runegalder’s spell book and keeps the spells that he binds to runes. Unlike a normal spell book, however, the spells are scribed in meteorite ink and blood that seals their magic power in the text itself. Essentially, the Runegalder’s Grimoire does the channeling latently for him.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Grimoire starts with 8 random Rudiments, though he must have at least 1 of each, and gains an additional Rudiment every level.</p><p style="margin:0px;">At level up, he then constructs his spells out of these Rudiments. These spells can’t have a Drain greater than 7 + their level (so at 1st level, his spells can only have a Drain of 6) when it is scribed into the Grimoire. A spell’s Rudiments cannot be redistributed and changed: spells in the Grimoire are immutable.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that spells cast by the Runegalder only last their Interval unless their Effect is stacked, in which case, it either increases that Interval by a like amount or gains the Stacking bonus. This is decided when the spell is cast.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, a 2nd level Runegalder scribes a new spell. He can max out at 7 Drain. He chooses to make it a Wall Shape (3 Drain), at Full Range (1 Drain), Near Origin (1 Drain) and for its Effect, he chooses Disorient (2 Drain), for a total of 7. He could have also made it Chain Shape instead for 1 Drain, and Stacked the Disorient Effect, if he wanted. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Spells inscribed at different levels count as completely different spells and must be sealed to different runes. So if the Runegalder has a 6 SP Flash Grenade and a 11 SP Flash Grenade, he would need two runes to cast both. He couldn’t simply bind “Flash Grenade” to one rune and then choose which he wanted to use in the moment.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Weirdcraft, 1)</strong> Through the course of her career, a Runegalder seeks to further their knowledge of the occult. They receive 1 free purchase of the Weirdcraft Skill Suite at every other level up. </p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> The Runegalder uses his body as a prison for latent weird-adept energies which wears on a person over time. He ages at twice the normal rate.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, the Runegalder's magic is 'dead' and so is less potent than other types of magic, thus allowing some to shrug off their spells.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> When shaping a spell, the Runegalder rolls a d20! + 10 + their level. All those that would be affected by the spell roll a d20! + their level. If their total is above the Runegalder's, they're unaffected by his magic. This roll is made regardless of whether or not the person wants to be affected by the spell.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to take another Weird-Adept Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double specialize in their Primary.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Runegalder Double Specialist</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>VANCIAN CASTING</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can seal a new spell every level.</p><h3>GRIMOIRE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your Grimoire starts at 10 Rudiments and new spells have 8 + ( level x 2 ) Drain. You gain 3 Rudiments per level.</p><h3>SKILL FOCUS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Skill Focus is increased to every level. </p></td></tr></table><h5>Flaws</h5><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Every person have flaws; little quirks of their personality or odd behaviors. These flaws are often a way of dealing with troubles in their life, letting off Stress or rationalizing their behavior to others. Other times they’re artifacts of a hard life, like a soldier whose missing an arm. </p><h1>Benefits & Penalties</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Flaws in Bonfire are a tradeoff: they’ll make your character less able to do things in certain arenas or harder to be around but allow you to invest in abilities and powers elsewhere. This is represented by the CrP bonus that you get from taking Flaws</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Another bonus is that by overcoming a character's Flaws, a person gains confidence and Honor. Essentially, this means by applying your Flaws to your detriment, your character becomes stronger. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is done very simply by saying that you think a Flaw would make something harder for your character in this situation and then giving yourself a -d4! to your Skill, Attack, or Defense roll or giving your opponent d4! Leverage. Regardless of whether or not you succeed, they gain Honor equal to your penalty. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The GM may award more Honor or inflict you with a larger penalty as seems appropriate for the situation. After all, if it's something your character really struggles with and it gives them a -d8!, it makes sense that they would get an equivalent amount of Honor for overcoming the challenge. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, note that if you're the one to bring up your Flaws, you get Honor regardless but if the GM has to do so, you only get Honor if you succeed so it is always better to bring them up yourself (unless you have a very inattentive GM). </p><h1>Gaining Flaws</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are two ways to select Flaws: Rolling and Cherry Picking. Rolling gives you more CrP per Flaw but Cherry Picking gives you more control. </p><h3>ROLLING FLAWS</h3><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Flaw Table Table </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll (d100)</td><td>Table</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1 - 25</td><td>Background</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>26 - 50</td><td>Behavioral</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>51 - 75</td><td>Mental</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>76 - 100</td><td>Physical</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"> Roll on the first table below and then roll on the corresponding table.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You can spend 1 CrP to reroll at any time but once you’ve committed to a table, you have to roll on that table.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Each Flaw after the first loses 5 CrP of its value per previous Flaw to a minimum of 0 CrP received.

So, the 3rd Flaw you pick will be at a -30 CrP.</p><h1>Flaw Descriptions</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While most Flaws can be reasonably looked up, some might need some clarification which is why they're listed below or additional penalties. We've also provided some handy tables you might find useful for figuring out the details of that Flaw. </p><h3>ADDICT</h3><table style="width:150px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Addiction </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll D20</td><td>Name</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1 - 5</td><td>Drugs</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6 - 10</td><td>Sex</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>11 - 15</td><td>Gambling</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>16 - 20</td><td>Alcohol</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can, of course, choose whatever addiction you feel fits your character, but we’ve provided a table you can use to generate one for you.</p><h3>ATHEIST</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The way of the divine is a mysterious path and someone mistake it for no path at all. Some refuse to believe that intelligent higher powers exist and so forfeit some of the blessings while others find worshipping such beings laughable, like giving reverence to the biggest bully on the block.</p><h3>BLIND, TOTAL</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> This character has completely lost his sight. He sees only pure white or pure black, unable to sense any movement around him.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> In melee combat, they defend and attack with a 1d6! And ranged combat is right out, however, if you insist, you’ll be attacking and defending with a 1d4, so enjoy your fumbles, you stubborn bastard.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Additionally, any Skill Challenges involving sight halves the person’s Skill Rank.</p><h3>BOAR FACED</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is the polite way of say that someone is ugly as sin. This could be the result of parentage or a bad accident, either way, people don’t like being around them or dealing with them. As mean as it might be, people judge books by their covers.</p><h3>DARK SECRET</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There’s something that this character is hiding and she’s worried that she’ll be found out. She’ll jealously guard every aspect of her life if she can for fear of being found out.</p><h3>DEBTOR</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has gotten into trouble financially. This character starts with 5d20 + 150 sc of debt instead of gaining a like amount to start off with. All their equipment much then be purchased on a credit of 50 sc that is also taken out of their debt. If they don’t make payments on it, they may find themselves on the bad end of the law or the loan shark they borrowed from.</p><h3>DERANGED</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> There’s holes in this character’s brains and he’s starting to slip into madness. The nature of this neurosis is up to the character.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The character doesn’t suffer the effects of Stress until it matches his Wisdom score, at that point, he has an episode and doubles his total Stress. Once, he’s recovered (dropped his Stress back down below his Wisdom), he suffers a permanent reduction 1 to both his Intellect and Wisdom.</p><h3>EPILEPTIC</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Something is not wired up just right in this character’s brain and that causes them to have little short outs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When something triggers a Trauma check for the character, or their Stress reaches above their Int score, there is a 1 in 8 chance of the character having a seizure, in which they’re completely helpless for the next 1d3 minutes.</p><h3>EXCOMMUNICATED</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> This character has invoked the wrath of an angry god, calling down divide judgement on his head. This is more commonly a member of the faithful whose fallen away or lost his way or willfully defies the cult’s teachings, but less commonly, it’s an outsider whose been declared an enemy of the faith. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Excommunicated members cannot gain the blessings of any miracles related to a single Covenant. Additionally, baleful invocations from priests of the deity that excommunicated them half their threshold.</p><h3>FATED</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Certain character’s bear a strange sign on them that marks them for doom. The cruel strings of fate weave together to form a noose for them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At creation, the GM rolls 1d8!. This is the number of sessions the character has before Fate begins to sharpen her shears. After that point, the character takes extra damage each time they're hit equal to how many sessions have passed since then.</p><h3>FERAL</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> The wild and untamed lands are home to frontier men and families. Occasionally, children escape and are raised only by the wild, occasionally wolves.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Feral characters still receive any free skills from their Archetype but any additional skills they try to pick up can only be from the Survival Skill Suite.</p><h3>HALF-LIFE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has died and forced back to life, maybe against his will. This character is affected by the Force Bind Spirit spell, though the Duration is set to 1d4! - 2 (minimum 1) years and a day. Why he came back is up to you. Perhaps he had some unfinished business or perhaps he was targeted accidently. In any case, now he lives a half-life.</p><h3>HAUNTED</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Mostly commonly, this character has done something to dishonor his clan and has been since been haunted by one of their ancestors, displeased by their actions.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The spirit takes the corporeal form of a rotting corpse wearing its death mask, bothering the possessed at all hours to restore his family’s honor and stop being such a failure. The ancestor will do nothing to protect their descendant and often make life harder for them when they can. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Unfortunately, decades, if not centuries, in the grave have made the ancestor more than a bit senile. Even if the character is to obtain Great Honor, the ancestor doesn’t care; what it really wants is for the character to sacrifice themselves in a heroic way or perform suicide.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This character doesn’t heal Stress naturally and loses 1 Honor at the end of every session.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Flaw may be paid off for half cost if the character has lasted 2 sessions in Great Honor, however it goes back up to full price if they slip out of Great Honor later.</p><h3>HEMOPHILIC</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These guys love to bleed. Well, they may not love it but they certainly do it a lot more than the rest of us. They take an additional d4 points of damage every time they're wounded. </p><h3>IDIOT SAVANT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character was born gifted. Or in other words, they were born with the ability to understand something but nothing else. This character picks an Advanced Skill or Training; all other Skills and Trainings cost double. The chosen Skill or Training now costs half.</p><h3>IMPISH</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character loves getting into trouble, mostly through pranks of all kinds. While she’s not inherently malicious, her pranks tend to be unwelcome.</p><h3>IMPOTENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If this character was a tree, he’d have particularly softwood, if you know what I mean. His lack of confidence in his abilities in the bedroom, tend to affect the other parts of his life, often snowballing; he loses an additional Honor for every 10 lost.</p><h3>INBRED</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Often a curse of the nobility that get too close to their cousins, inbreeding can stunt the mental capacity of their offspring. Typically, this is pretty mild for the most part, but it means that increasing this character’s Intellect score costs double.</p><h3>LIMP</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Something isn’t working just right, whether from a birth defect or a war wound, causing this character to hobble along at a slower pace. Characters with a limp move at half their speed at all times.</p><h3>MISSING ARM</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Most likely this is the result of some terrible accident or horrific war wound, though some people are born with an arm missing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character with this Flaw is unable to wield two handed weapons, employ bows or crossbows, or anything else that needs two hands.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Flaw may be rolled multiple times, with the second time you take this flaw making it worth 60 CrP, as it prevents the character from using any weapons, and makes them unable to cast spells with Somatic components</p><h3>MISSING EAR</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> While it won’t limit your ability to hear entirely, the shape of the ear does make it easier to hear things.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The first time you roll this Flaw, all Listening Checks take a penalty of -3.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The second time, all Listening checks are 3 Difficulties harder and your initiative dice becomes one worse. You gain 25 CrPs instead of 20 (in addition to the CrPs from the first time you picked this Flaw up). </p><h3>MISSING EYE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> You can imagine that a character with one eye gone would have an issue with his depth perception. You’d be correct.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The first time a character gains this Flaw, he automatically attacks second when engaging in melee, even if his weapon has the greater reach and everything is counted as two range categories further for ranged weaponry.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The second time this Flaw is rolled, the penalties are replaced by those of the Blind, Total Flaw and he gains an additional 25 CrP.</p><h3>MONOTHEIST</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> For this character, there is only one true god and all other divines are false deities or the work of devils.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> He will refuse help from pagan clerics and is bound to only miracles within his chosen Covenant. </p><h3>MULE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While they may not show it, this character is the result of mixed ancestry and something about their unnatural genesis makes them sterile, unable to promulgate. While this will definitely make creating a dynasty an issue, certain carousers may hardly consider this a Flaw.</p><h3>NO DEPTH PERCEPTION</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has a hard time reading distances making it so that he automatically attacks second when engaging in melee combat, even if his weapon has the greater reach and everything is counted as two range categories further for ranged weaponry.</p><h3>OPUSPHOBIA</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Opusphobia is defined by a fear or repulsion of a certain career choice. Someone with this Flaw may dislike horse merchants because he sees them all at crooks or innkeepers because he’s afraid they’re working with the Thieves Guilds.</p><h3>PASSIONLESS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Whether because of imbalance in their brain or they haven’t really found that thing that calls to them, a Passionless character has problems really being interested in any given subject they try to engage in. Passions for them cost double to purchase and increase and any situation die they gain from their Skills are always one smaller.</p><h3>POOR</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some characters don’t have the financial leg up that others have. These characters must choose the following Equipment Kit during Step 11 of Character Creation. </p><table style="width:350px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="3" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Pauper's Kit </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Item</td><td>Size</td><td>Sellback</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1 S weapon</td><td>S</td><td>15</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Breeches, Good Linen, Light, Fine*</td><td>n/a</td><td>12</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Shirt, Wool, Fine*</td><td>n/a</td><td>13</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Sandals, Leather, Natural Color*</td><td>n/a</td><td>4</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Rations, Person, Day x 3</td><td>3S</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td colspan="2">Weight: 1M 1S</td><td>Extra Cash: 1d10! cc</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"></table><h3>PHOBIC</h3><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Phobias </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll D10</td><td>Type</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Animals</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>Being Restrained</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td>Combat</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td>Commitment</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5</td><td>Conflict</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6</td><td>Magic</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>7</td><td>Religion</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>8</td><td>Sickness</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>9</td><td>The Dead</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>10</td><td>The Opposite Gender</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can, of course, choose whatever fear you feel fits your character, but we’ve provided a table you can use to generate one for you.</p><h3>REFUGEE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Fleeing from their homeland for either economic, religious, or conflict reasons, this character finds themselves in a foreign land. Their flight has forced them to leave much of their belongings behind, halving their starting cash and they tend to be unfamiliar with the language and customs. Their native language is not the main one for this area and the Language and Law of the country they’re fleeing to costs double as they had to learn it under stressful circumstances</p><h3>SECRET IDENTITY</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> For whatever reason, whether they’re hiding from enemies or they want to put their old life behind them, this character is trying to keep their past a secret. When this flaw is rolls, this character selects one of their Archetypes to be the remnant of their past. Any mention of the Archetypes abilities nets this character 1 Stress.</p><h3>SELF MARTYR</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Life doesn’t feel complete if people don’t know how much you’re sacrificing for them.</p><h3>SENSITIVE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has superb senses compared to others, however it makes it challenging for them to function sometimes as they can just get overloaded.</p><h3>SENSITIVE HEARING</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character is incredibly prone to noise. Other’s normal talking voice sound to them like they’re yelling. You’ll think this would help them suss out noise more effectively but instead it makes it harder to hear because there’s too much sensory input.</p><h3>TALKER</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Whether around the campfire or in stressful situation, this person can’t keep their mouth shut. They’ll just talk and talk, only stopping to take necessary breathes.</p><h3>THRALL</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thralls are those taken in raids or the children of slaves. Technically, they’re ‘free’ but they have a social stigma that follow them. Thralls gain no extra starting cash and half the amount of equipment the kit normally starts with and starting a Conflict with someone of high status automatically gives you 3 points.</p><h3>VOW of POVERTY</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Middle Realm corrupts and those that wish to come closer to the Gods’ Realm sometimes eschew worldly possessions. This character only keeps enough wealth on them to buy basic food to sustain them for that day, all other wealth is donated to any local cults. They give their goods to the needy, not fellow adventurers. Their Max Favor is increased by 1. </p><h5>Character Vitals</h5><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The purpose of this chapter is to condense all the rules for calculating things about your character so that it can keep the other chapters to just rules you’ll need at the spur of the moment during gameplay. To this end, these rules are missing why they’re important and what you’ll actually use them for but they do reference the chapter where more is to be found. </p><h1>Stress</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Working under pressure can get to you. When your crew mates are relying on you to pull out a win, it can mess with your head. Your character can become stressed under these circumstances and stress can later manifest in odd behaviors.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Characters can gain Stress in two ways in a lot of ways and those are discussed in their various sections - taking damage, making Skill Checks, etc. - the only one we’ll go over here is Stress can be gained (and healed) from acting out your character’s social Characteristics, especially when not playing them would be a huge benefit.</p><h3>STRESS PENALTIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Stress affects almost everything you do, making your life harder and your character becomes emotionally pent up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Every 10 points of Stress gives you a penalty of 1 to Defense, Skill Check difficulties, Running and Sprinting time.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Honor Through Accountability </h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> In the heat of the moment, it’s hard to keep track of all the bonuses and penalties that apply to situations, especially the penalties and especially Stress penalties, which change during the fight.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Because of this, it isn’t required that you apply Stress penalties. However, if you do, you gain 1 Honor and the other side also applies their Stress penalty without that extra Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If the GM reminds you that you need to apply your Stress, you don’t get anything but the penalty.</p></td></tr></table><h3>HEALING STRESS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Stress heals slowly over time but there are things you can do to speed it up. You have to actively go out and do things that relax your character. There are several things you can do. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The first is to give into his nature. By role playing his Flaws in a detrimental way, a character can relieve 1 or more Stress (GM’s option). This means that when a character sees a situation where his Stress could give him a disadvantage, he can bring it up the GM. If approved, the character heals Stress. The GM may also suggest this option as well if she things the situation warrants it.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The second way is through hobbies. Hobbies are based off your character's Social Characteristics, but besides that, they can be anything, from whoring it up to spending time with the family or working in their shop. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You gain 1 point of Relaxation for each hour spent on a hobby, though you can only spend up to the number of dice that Characteristic has in hours per day. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Finally, you can indulge in creature comforts. This can be done by by buying a nice bedroll or even hiring someone to set up your camp for you so you can relax at the end of the day. The rule of thumb is that each applicable Trait the equipment you have gives you an additional point of Relaxation when applicable. So, an extra soft, double padded, and tailored bedroll will always do you good but a waterproof tent will really only give you a bonus in inclement weather. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> When your Relaxation matches your current Stress, you heal 1 Stress and your Relaxation drops to 0 again. Yes, that means that the more Stressed you become, the harder it is to decompress yourself. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Also, as an aside here; the Musician and Cooking/Baking Advanced Skills also help heal Stress, so you can look into those.</p><h3>MENTAL BREAKDOWNS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> When your total Stress equals your ( Int + Wis ) * 2, called your Stress Threshold, you've gotten to the point that you just can't take it anymore. This results in a Mental Breakdown for your character. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When this happens they do everything in their power to separate themselves from the stressor as quickly as possible. If they're in a scenario that directly threatens their life (like combat or dangling from a cliff), they'll separate themselves as quickly as possible but will pay little attention to their companion's safety. At this point, they're so overwhelmed, they don't really care. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character having a Mental Breakdown can still gain Stress but should they gain enough to go over twice their Stress Treshold, they suffer a heart attack and die.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Even if your character doesn't suffer a heartattack, they'll be shaken and changed from the experiance. When they dip below their Stress Treshold again, they suffer 2 negative Long Term Repercussions as laid out in the Repercussions of a Conflict section in <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/8"]' [queryParams]="{search: 'AnyonewithdiBpMxTcoIPP'}">Chapter 8: Social</a>.</p><h1>Vitality</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Vitality represents how close you are to passing out and dying. It is both your health and fatigue. As you take damage, you will get closer to death and gain more penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Vitality is divided into 5 categories, representing what percentage of damage a character has taken: </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>FRESH: 0%</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>TIRED: >1%</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>HURT: >25%</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>BLOODIED: >50%</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>WOUNDED: >75%</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>BLEEDING OUT: >100%</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"> To calculate how much Vitality you have for each category, add a roll of your Primary Archetype’s Vitality Die to your Constitution + their Vitality Size Modifier. That’s your total. Divide that by 4. If you have a remainder, alternate between rounding down on every category except the Wounded category.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, if you’re a Human with and your Vitality Die is a d10 and you roll a 7 with a Constitution of 12, you have 29 Vitality. You’re Tired at 28, Hurt at 22, Bloodied at 15, and Wounded 8.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Record your Vitality Die roll on your character sheet. </p><h3>DROPPING A VITALITY CATEGORY & ENCUMBRANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> As stated, the more damage you take, the harder the fight becomes. When you drop a Vitality Category, you gain an amount of Stress equal to your Encumbrance.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your Encumbrance is equal to your Con Encumb. + Wis Encumb. + Encumb. from armor and shields + however many times you’re over your carry limit.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CHANGING ENCUMBRANCE WHILE WOUNDED</strong> The Stress you gain from wounds isn't healed by normal means; it's only healed when either your Encumbrance is lowered or when your wounds heal enough to move you up a category.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> That means, if you took 10 Stress dropping from a Vitality Category, taking a spa day wouldn't help. Instead, you should see a surgeon or a doctor. Now, what you could do is not carry so much gear around. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Now, the flip side of this is that if you become MORE Encumbered while wounded, you gain that amount of Stress instantly. So, continuing the above example, if you were to then pick up your Light Shield again, your Encumbrance would raise by 6 and you'd gain 6 Stress. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PASSING OUT</strong> All characters pass out when they start Bleeding Out, but it is possible that they'll pass out before then. If your remaining Vitality is less than or equal to your Stress Penalty, your character collapses, helpless but not actively bleeding out. In a sense, he's forced to Take a Breather. or remain helpless.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if you've got 30 Stress and 29 Vitality, when you've taken 25 damage, your character collapses, forced to Take a Breather.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Wound Category Exception</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Just as an aside - going from Fresh to Tired doesn’t count as changing a Wound Category for purposes of triggering a Trauma check.</p></td></tr></table><h3>TAKING A BREATHER</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Pausing and not doing anything but move at a Stroll while not Threatened for 20 Seconds - Con, minimum 3 Seconds, heals you half the damage (rounded down) that you've take since the last time you've Taken a Breather. Damage healed this way is taken from the smallest non-long term fatigue wound.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If you become Threatened while taking a breather but continue to try and catch your breath, you take 1 Stress for every second you remain so.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’re attacked and still definitely rest, you reduce your defense dice by 1 size. If they miss, your breather is unaffected, though in either case, the attacker loses an Honor.</p><h3>HEALING</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Combat is dangerous. Even if you survive, you could end up with wounds that you carry with you for months on end.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Each time damage is done, it is tracked in a new wound.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Wounds heals at a slow rate. Each point takes a number of days equal to the damage done to heal it 1 point.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, a 5 point wound takes 5 days to become a 4 point wound, which takes 4 days to becomes a 3 point wound, and so on. That means it takes 15 days to completely heal ( 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thankfully, each wound heals simultaneously. So, if you have 3 separate 4 point wounds, you’ll be completely healed by day 10.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RECUPERATION (HEALING WITH RELAXATION)</strong> Another option you can do to speed up long-term healing is to rest and indulge yourself.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If the only Stress your character has is from Wounds, any points of Relaxation gained that day are taken off the days to heal off your Wounds.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This is somewhat limited however since you can only drop a single Wound's days to heal by the amount it had left on that Severity. So, if I have a 10 Severity Wound, with 8 days of healing left, gaining 11 points of Relaxation, would only reduce it to a 9 Severity Wound with 9 days left to heal that day. However, if I also had another Wound, I could use that otherwise wasted Relaxation on it.</p><h1>Honor</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Honor is a measure how not only how a person measures their own integrity but also how other people see them. Honor isn’t about doing the commonsense thing; it’s about doing the heroic thing. People who run from a fight, even when outnumbered, lose Honor. People who let others talk bad about them and don’t get even lose Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The question of Honor isn’t a question of good and evil; many evil men have been honorable. It’s more about living up to the ideals of your culture and being true to your inner self.</p><h3>BONUS CrP</h3><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Bonus Honor </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Honor of Last Character</td><td>Bonus Crp</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Great Honor</td><td>50</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>High Honor</td><td>35</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Average Honor</td><td>25</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Low Honor</td><td>10</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Dishonor</td><td>0</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"> If this is your first Bonfire character in a campaign, you receive a bonus 25 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’re here because you’ve had a character die, this bonus CrP is based on the Honor category your character was in when they died.</p><h3>STARTING HONOR</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Honor category in which you start is determined by your “Start Honor”, listed under your Charisma. You start at the bottom of the corresponding category.</p><h3>HONOR CATEGORIES & BONUSES</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Honor has its benefits. Confidence allows you to push yourself a little bit more than you otherwise would. During the game, you can spend your Honor points to influence anything, rolls or static metrics, whenever you want on a 1 to 1 basis. Doing so lowers your Honor but might save your character’s life. So, if you roll a 13 and your opponent rolls a 14, you could spend 3 Honor to beat their total. Likewise, if an enemy deals 8 damage to you and you have 6 Honor, you could spend all of it and only take 2 damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Additionally, each category has an Honor Dice, which can be rolled to add or subtract like Honor. These are typically rewarded through your Racial Temperament. Once used, they go away but they stay with your character as long as they live. Certain Archetype abilities may also give you them temporarily, in which case, the Archetype will note for how long you have them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Honor cannot go above 25 or below 0. The size of the Honor Die is also determined at the beginning of session and doesn’t change during play even if the category does.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DISHONOR (0 - 5 Honor, No Honor Die)</strong> The lowest category, this person is unsure that they have what it takes to be a hero and so every decision is laced with hesitation and uncertainty.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LOW HONOR (6 - 10 Honor, d4!)</strong> This character hasn’t really proved anything, one way or another. Others and herself are waiting for her to make her mark on the world.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AVERAGE HONOR (11 - 15 Honor, d6!)</strong> Having reached this category, the character has shown that they have potential and some follow through.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HIGH HONOR (16 - 20 Honor, d8!)</strong> She has now separated herself from the common rabble and can stand a head above the crowd.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GREAT HONOR (20 - 25 Honor, d10!)</strong> This rare sliver represents those who can perfectly balance being ahead of others but not so much so that they invoke the ire of those below them as well as being confident while not being cocky.</p><h3>END OF SESSION HONOR AWARDS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> At the end of each session, the players will elect each other’s characters for things they think that character deserved Honor for. It is generally poor form to elect yourself but is also reasonable if you pulled off something amazing and the rest of the group didn't seem to notice.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These elections need to fit into one of these three categories:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STRENGTH</strong> This character demonstrated strength based on how their character’s culture defines strength, which could be physical prowess but could also be cunning or grifting.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MASTERY</strong> This is given when a character solves a tricky problem or came up with a creative solution. Note, this shouldn't be given for good rolls unless the players want to lose Honor for bad rolls; this is about out of the box thinking.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COURAGE</strong> When the chips were down, did your character give up the fight or did they really show what it means to be a hero and stare down death?</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ROLEPLAYING</strong> Did the player really role play his character? Where his decisions about what he thought gave him the best chance to win or was it about what his character thought would be a good idea? Note, that since players are electing each other, jackasses who use “that’s just what my character would do” to dick over the party won’t get rewarded for this much. This should be specifically linked to a character's Social Characteristics.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GAINING HONOR DICE</strong> Whenever you go up an Honor Category, you gain a free use of your Honor Dice. Also, when you reach 25 Honor, you get one as well, even though you didn't technically go up a category. Once used, they go away but they stay with your character as long as they live. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Certain Archetype abilities may also give you them temporarily, in which case, the Archetype will note for how long you have them. </p><p style="margin:0px;">For each of these categories, the GM can also dock Honor from a character. Did they run away or did they conveniently forget any Characteristics that would have screwed them over?</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">That and spending Honor are the two main ways of losing Honor.</p><h5>Skills</h5><p style="margin:0px;"> Skills are used as a way to determine the success or failure of a given action, based on what your character knows about the given subject or about how to perform the given task. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You don’t have to use these rules all the time, i.e., you don’t have to roll to see if your character successfully walks across a room, but at times they’re a good way to semi-randomly determine the outcome of a tricky task, i.e., walking across a room full of traps. </p><h1>Skill Introduction</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> There are two types of skills that you’re going to be pulling from: Skill Suites and Advanced Skills.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Skill Suites represent broad swathes of knowledge that cover a variety of subjects. Suites are hard to increase because there’s so much ground to cover but can be used if you don’t have the specific Advanced Skill. An example of this is the Survival and Lore Skill Suites.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Advanced Skills are more tightly focused, covering one intellectual discipline. They’re easier to master but may not be applicable in every case. An example of this would be the First Aid, Fire Building, and Foraging skills in the Survival Skill Suite and the Law, History, and Medicine skills in the Lore Skill Suite.</p><h3>ACQUIRING SKILLS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Throughout your character’s career, she’ll acquire and improve her skills. Both types of skills are purchased with CrP, that is spent either at Character Creation or on leveling up. All skills have a unique cost that represents how easy or difficult they are to master. You pay the price as noted in the section below, you improve the skill.</p><h3>CALCULATING RANK</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL SUITES </strong>For your Skill Suites, your starting Rank is the Skill Bonus listed under the corresponding Stat. For Suites with multiple Stats, average the Skill Bonus, rounded down. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ADVANCED SUITES </strong> Your starting Rank for Advanced Skills is the Rank for the mother Skill Suite.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PURCHASING A SKILL </strong>Advanced Skills cost their Base Cost - Skill Bonus + (Current Rank * 2), while Skill Suites cost their Base Cost Base Cost - Skill Bonus + (Current Rank * 5), both have a minimum of 1. Note that, like Skills Suites above, if there are multiple Stats attached to a Skill, average the Skill Bonus, rounded down.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Every purchase increases your Rank in that Skill by 1. Purchases of Skill Suites also raises the Rank of any child Advanced Skills you’ve already purchased, so that’s nice.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The exception to this is the Weirdcraft Advanced Skills, that more expensive as you purchase other Weirdcraft Advanced Skills. The price is the Base Cost + 2 * (Current Ranks + number of previous Weirdcraft Advanced Skills you've got Ranks in). Going back and purchasing more Ranks in a Weirdcraft Advanced Skills you’re already got Ranks in doesn’t “shift” it around for purposes of “number of previous Traditions trained in”. </p><h1>The Basics (Skill Checks)</h1><p style="margin:0px;">Before we go off talking about Skill Challenges, time, equipment, and all those other things, it’s first important to understand the very basic mechanic all of those things will hang off of: Skill Checks.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Skill Checks are any checks made that move the Skill Challenge along and determines a success or failure.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At their very basic, Skill Checks have both sides rolling a d20! and adding any applicable Skill’s Rank and any modifiers for difficulty. The person with the highest total wins and you successfully bypass or eliminate the Obstacle, depending on the situation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">It is assumed that your character is trying their hardest to be successfully in whatever they attempt and so any Check you make inflicts 5 Stress. However, you can buy down that Stress with points off your total result on a 1 to 1 basis. You declare this before you get the results of the Check, however. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Answering a Question</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Another use of a single use Skill Check is answering a question that you don’t know the answer to like “out of these two walls, which looks easier to climb?” Things that would be reasonable for them to be there but you don’t know because you didn’t prepare for that question.</p></td></tr></table><h1>Skill Challenges</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Skill Checks refer to a single roll against a single Skill, while a Skill Challenge refers to a host of Skill Checks. To use a metaphor: a Skill Challenge would be breaking into the castle. The Skill Checks would be climbing the walls, hiding in the shadows, sneaking past the guards, listening at doors, lockpicking any locks, etc.</p><h3>OBJECTIVES AND OBSTACLES</h3><p style="margin:0px;">A Skill Challenge doesn’t exist without something that your character wants and at least one thing that stands in their way.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This could be something straightforward: I want to get out of this jail cell but a locked door is in my way, or it could be something more complicated like I want to capture this outlaw but he’s several days’ ride ahead of me.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These are your Objective and Obstacles, respectively.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Achieving your Objective is a matter of beating or getting past all the Obstacles in your way.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Obstacles are beaten through successfully rolling Skill Checks, which will be discussed more in the next section. Note that an Obstacle can continue to be a factor that needs to be considered, for example, a guard patrol, or it can be something that only needs to be taken care of once, for example, unlocking a door.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Obstacles also have Failure Threshold, which represents badly you have to fail against them to actually fail. More on this in the Failures, Hard & Soft section below.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>The Single Check</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Before we dive in, I think it's worth saying that there may be times when you have something that might call for a Skill Check but not a Skill Challenge. Most often you'll do this when there is danger but not a huge time crunch, like, for instance, players leaping over a cliff or when there’s a chance of failure, like the player not knowing a monster weakness.</p><p style="margin:0px;">In that case, it would be perfectly reasonable to just call for a single Jumping (or Monster Craft) Check. If the players want to do some Preparation or use any of the other tools at their disposal, they can.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Or, if there is a time crunch but it is so narrow players really wouldn't have the time to prepare, like having to jump the chasm while a horde of brigands with bows are closing it, you might also just default to the single roll: no need to break out these rules in that case.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In these cases, the Failure Threshold of the Check would be 0, meaning a failure is a failure, but you can spice it up by having the jump almost make it but now the player is just barely hanging out: however much time you want to spend on it.</p></td></tr></table><h3>DIFFICULTY</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Difficulty is a dice that is added to the Skill Check based on things that might be going on at the time to either help or hinder your success.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Obstacles can have static, variable, shrinking, circular, growing, or universal difficulties. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STATIC </strong>means that the dice pretty much stays the same, outside of player interaction. This is often used for one off checks and not really used as the main part of a Skill Challenge because, let’s face it, doing the same Check over and over again isn’t that interesting.</p><p style="margin:0px;">What you'll mainly see is Static Difficulties linked together in an Obstacle. So, for instance, a rock wall that is slippery at the base, then has a section with a lot of handholds, and finishes with an overhang, would be three separate Checks, the first with a d12! difficulty for the wall, the next with a d4! for the players, and the final with a d10!, again for the wall.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHRINKING </strong>means that it starts high but then the dice shrinks as time passes, often becoming static at a certain point. This is when the threat becomes less and less severe, and I would use this sparingly and with other types of Obstacles, but it can represent the fact that leaving a place is often easier than getting in.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GROWING </strong>is the opposite of shrinking: it starts low and then increases as time passes, again, sometimes becoming static at a certain point. This is used to represent threats that continue to grow, often times when there is time pressure.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>UNIVERSAL </strong>This is a term for an Obstacle that will go off at some time but won't be directly faced by the players. It represents a chance encounter, such as running into someone randomly, or a stroke of bad luck, like bad weather. Unlike other Obstacles, players won't make Checks directly against it but any Failure (or Success) against another Obstacle in that Challenge adds a like amount of Failure (or Success) to any Universal Obstacles.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This can also be used for timed Challenges, such as a chance or encroaching deadline. In that case you not only count both Soft Successes and Failures, as they represent time passing, but also questions your players ask count as 1 Soft Failure, representing them taking time to get stock of their surroundings, which you oftentimes don’t have as much time to do under pressure.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CIRCULAR </strong>means it starts at a difficulty, grows to a certain difficulty, and then shrinks down to its original difficulty, rinse and repeat, ad nauseam. It can also start shrinking, if you’d like. This is often used as patrols, like guards and such, but also a monster stalking an area would be represented by this type of Obstacle though you would have it be a bit more random to represent that unpredictability.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LINKED </strong>Obstacles are Obstacles that whose outcomes affect one another. So, for instance, if the players are in a wagon chase down a rocky road, with one player at the helm, stirring, and the others in the back firing crossbows, how well the player of the reigns does affects the attack rolls of those in the back. In this case, add or subtract the number of Soft Failures or Soft Successes to the Check of any linked Obstacles.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that Linked Obstacles will also be paired with another Difficulty type.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Multi-Layer Checks</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Let's say that you're trying to deduce facts about bears before you go to fight one. The thing is, there is a lot to know about bears and your character probably isn't going to know all of it, so making a single Check is too binary while making multiple Checks is too tedious. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In steps the Mutli-Layer Check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In this case, the GM would assign Difficulty Dice to the different facts about bears based on how esoteric the knowledge is. He would then roll 1 d20! and all of those Difficulty Dice. You would only roll a single Check and the compare that to the difference totals to see if you recall those facts. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>"Pausing" the Skill Challenge</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">The players don’t always have to be making Skill Checks during a Skill Challenge - they should only do so when it makes sense.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, (using the above example) if the patrols aren’t very good and the guards get too far away from the players to reasonably hear them, no Check should be required.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But that doesn’t mean that time stops: if the players wait long enough, the guards will return and Checks will need to start up again.</p></td></tr></table><h3>FAILURES, HARD & SOFT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Failing a Check doesn’t automatically mean that you’re instantly screwed: Failing a single Move Silently Check doesn’t result in the guards catching you. In Bonfire, there are soft failures and hard failures.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Every Obstacle will have a number of Soft Failures it can gain before it hard fails. This is called it's Failure Threshold. You gain Soft Failures by failing Skill Checks: every 5 points below what you needed to get gives the Obstacle 1 Soft Failure.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Soft Failures represent complications, such as the guard hearing something, or you leaving a clue behind that might give someone a heads up that you're there. An Obstacle gets +2 for every Soft Failure is has on it. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When an Obstacle gets more Soft Failures than its Failure Threshold, it hard fails. Hard failures are when something bad actually happens. In this case, it does result in you getting caught by the guards, or it results in your falling off the wall and taking damage. Even after a hard failure, you can sometimes try again, like in the case of falling off the wall.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Failure doesn’t diminish during the Skill Challenge but it does reset for a new one.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Soft Failure in the Narrative</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Soft Failures don’t mean that the Skill Challenge grinds to a halt while the players keep reattempting that Skill: instead it should represent the players coming closer to danger.</p><h1>Strategies</h1><h3>ASSETS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">These represent static pools of knowledge or information that you can pull from. So, for instance, a book on the subject, or a library are examples of an Asset but also an old friend who used to be a ranger could give you a few pointers so could give you a bonus to the Navigation Check you’re going to have to make to find those ruins. </p><p style="margin:0px;">Basically, anything you can think of that might apply might be an Asset you can draw on.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Assets add their Skill Rank to your Check, however this happens slowly based on that Asset's Time Investment. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For each period of the Time Investment you spend with the Asset, you gain a +1 to one of your future Checks, up until the Asset's Rank.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, you go to your old ranger friend to get information about the local area. You know he happens to be a talker, so you know it’ll take you at least 2 hours (his Time Investment) to start to get anything useful out of him so you decide to spend the day with him, spending about 8 hours there.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Now, your friend doesn’t remember as much as he used to so his Navigation is Rank 3. After spending 8 hours with him, you get a +3 to your Navigation Prep Check. If you have stayed 6 or 7 hours, you would have still gotten that +3, while if you had stayed for 2 hours, you would have only gotten only a +1.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You don’t automatically know the Rank or the Time Investment of an Asset.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Another benefit of Assets is that they allow you to do multiple Preparation for a single Skill Check and the same Asset can be used to Prepare for multiple different checks. A library, for example, could allow you to Prepare for both a Monster Craft and History check.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Assets can also be increased and expanded upon as well, increasing its Rank. A good relationship with a contact might give you information quicker, donating to the local library may increase its selection, or hiring excavators to dig up a ruin may unearth more artifacts that help you decipher that ancient script.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There may be some special cases where an Asset will take care of itself but you may have to check back on it, such as Snaring in the forest. You set your trap and then a day or two later, you can go back and check it to see if you caught anything - in the meantime, you can get other work done.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Using Other Players as Assets</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">I think it's completely reasonable that players would want to use each other's characters as Assets and why shouldn't they? So, in this case, the Time Investment is set at 250 minutes, with each point of Intellect that Asset has taking 10 minutes off. This means that a character with an Intellect of 13 has a Time Investment of 120 minutes, or 2 hours. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">GMs should also feel free to reward players who sit there and talk things out and plan by awarding the Asset bonus as well, even if they don't spend a full hour+ planning.</p></td></tr></table><h3>EQUIPMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Your kit can really pull you through in a pinch.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Players are assumed to be using any and all equipment that would help them with a check and you can choose to have one or more of these pieces of equipment to give you, in that moment, a reroll one of one your dice (taking the better of the two). You can have multiple pieces of equipment apply but the reroll can only be redeemed once per Check.</p><p style="margin:0px;">On top of this, if the gear you’re using has Traits that applies, you add any of those applicable bonuses to whichever roll you keep.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For the first redemption of this bonus between Maintenance Prep Checks this comes with no penalty but every time after that, the tool degrades, giving it a -1 regardless of whether you succeed or not. While players are assumed to be using all equipment that might be useful without having to specifically state as such, if a player did point out how a piece of equipment is being used to help them, or if they use equipment in an unorthodox but clever way, they gain 1 Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can use faulty equipment (ones with a negative modifier), since something is better than nothing. This still gives you a reroll but if your roll is equal to or below the equipment's absolute value than it breaks. So, if you roll a 5 or less while using a -5 rope, the rope snaps, dropping you to the ground. This applies to defenses for shields and weapons.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Assets & Equipment Based Skills</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Some skills are only going to be useful if you have the proper equipment or the right Asset. For instance, if you’re not out in the wilderness, you can’t really use Snaring or if you don’t have the proper tools or a woodshop, Maintenance won’t do you any good. This will need to be handled on a case to case basis.</p></td></tr></table><h3>HELPER SKILLS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Let’s say that you’re tracking someone in the wilderness. You have Hunting at Rank 4 and Endurance at Rank 3. Seems like being able to move quickly over a longer period of time, should help you catch the guys and it does. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you have another Advanced Skill that you think might help you, you can add it for the normal Stress Dice penalty and roll a Stress Dice.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Stress Dice</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Much like in a Social Conflict, your character is probably going to get Stress Dice. Note that, unless it says otherwise, that dice is a d6!.</p><p style="margin:0px;">When any of these tools note that you roll a Stress Dice, if you don’t have one, you simply gain one that then waits in the wings to be rolled the next time you roll a tool. You can gain multiple Dice this way without rolling them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At the end of Challenge, you roll all Stress Dice and add it to your Character’s Stress.</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This may seem like it is nearly identical to Preparation, and they are very close. The difference is that Preparation is a general thing that applies to a Skill Check you’re going to make in the future, while using a helper Skill is in the moment and is specific to the scenario. You can use both at the same time, since the help Skill gives a bonus and Preparation gives a reroll.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Skill Mobbing</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For GMs, note that Helper Skills are how you handle Skill Mobbing, where everyone just overpowers a roll by all rolling against it. Instead, only one person rolls and only those with an applicable Advanced Skill and willing to take that Stress Dice add their Rank to help out. </p></td></tr></table><h3>MULTI-TASKING</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Let’s be realistic here: you’re probably going to end up trying to do two things at once, like climbing a wall and doing so quietly.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If that’s the case, you’re going to have to “split” your d20! into smaller dice and assign those to each of the Checks you’re trying to make, because your attention is divided. The total max value of the dice can never exceed 20 but it can be lower than it. The other side will still be rolling full d20!s against you.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, if you’re climbing a wall and trying to do so quietly, you’d have to make a Climbing and a Move Silently Check. You could split it like so: d12! for Climbing and d8! for Move Silently, or d10! for Climbing and d10! for Move Silently, or d12!+d4! for Move Silently and d4! for Climbing.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Or you could just say “screw being quiet” and roll a d20! for Climbing and take a 0 for Move Silently. In this case, the GM would just roll against your Skill Rank. So, if you choose to ignore Move Silently but have a Rank 4 in it, the GM would roll their dice, and you can hope they don’t roll higher than 4.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Either way, besides this, it works like a normal Check</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Not Paying Attention</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Multi-Tasking is also used when someone isn't paying attention, such as a guard whose on watch but he's been there for several hours at this point so he's not doing it so closely. In this case, start at a d10!, lowering it further as needs be. </p></td></tr></table><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Helping Others</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">It feels good to help people and Bonfire is all about group cooperation. The fighter helps the skill monkey survive combat and the skill monkey helps the fighter not look like an idiot while doing detective work.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">And how you help other characters will really depend on the situation. Perhaps your Preparation can be used to help another person hide or perhaps you have a bit of knowledge that they don’t.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Really, this will be done to what feels right in the moment but this note is here to draw attention to someone helping you as an Asset and someone adding their Rank to yours with a Helper Skill, and how they’re different. </p><p style="margin:0px;">And the difference is time. If you have plenty of time to coach someone while they’re climbing a cliff face, you’d be an Asset and nobody would take a Stress Die.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But if you’re being chased by the guards and it’s a matter of seconds or minutes, you’d add a Helper Skill and both of you would need to take the Stress Die.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that if the skill monkey is also trying to climb the cliff face and coach as they go, that would be considered a d10! worth of effort for Multi-Tasking, though you don’t have to actually roll to see if you help. </p></td></tr></table><h3>PREPARATION</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Preparation is anything your character does to help a specific Skill Check that will be made in the future (even if that future is 2 seconds from now). Note that this doesn't have to be a Check you make: it can also apply to an ally's Check (if it makes sense).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Usually, these only take a couple of seconds but can vary widely depending on the circumstances. Throwing a rock is a matter of moments while constructing a gilly suit will take a lot longer.</p><p style="margin:0px;">As long as there is time, there is no chance of failure or, if the players have plenty of time, Preparation just happens. Mark what you did for later in the Skill Challenge.</p><p style="margin:0px;">However, if there is a time crunch or a chance of failure, Preparation works like a normal Skill Check.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Either way, you only get one Prep Check per Advanced Skill that applies for each upcoming Check, unless you have Assets but remember that they do take time.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">That means that if you know you're going to have to make a jump, you can use Acrobatics to stretch, Endurance to do a few practice sprints to the edge, and Sports (long jumping) to remember techniques all to prep for the same Jump check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When you redeem Preparation that you’ve readied, you can reroll one of the dice that was rolled for the Check. This means either the base dice or the difficulty dice for either you or the Obstacle.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Planning & Action Phases</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">While it isn’t entirely black and white, it’s helpful to think of Challenges as composing two phases: planning and action; the laying out the plan and then the heist.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Planning is gathering intel, getting your team and equipment together, and planning your route of attack. This is where you’ll use Preparation, Taking Your Time, and Assets mostly.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Action phase is when you’ll be doing a lot of the Checks and Stress, as well as equipment and companions - using what you learned in the Prep Phase to help you get through the sticky parts.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But don’t get too hung up on separating these ideas though. Even during the heist, you might find it worth your time to sit on your heels and take your time while doing some Preparation as there will almost certainly be problems that crop up that you need to adjust to.</p></td></tr></table><h3>RUSHING IT</h3><p style="margin:0px;">On the flipside, if you’re in a hurry to get the job down, you can just rush it. This subtracts 50% from the estimated time but gives you a -5. Like Taking Your Time, this can be done multiple times in a row to half the time again but it also increases the penalty by 1.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Failures don’t consider this -3 while determining the extent of your failure and success means you bought yourself some more time: removing the amount you succeed by, with the -3, from the Failure on one of the Obstacles.</p><h3>TAKING YOUR TIME</h3><p style="margin:0px;">The other thing that you can do is take your time and really try and do the job well. Doubling the time for your Check gives you a +6. This can be done multiple times in a row to gain a further bonus but each time lowers the bonus by 1, down to +0. Regardless of how long you take your time, you always only roll 1 Stress Dice.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if it would take you 15 minutes to search a room, you could take 30 minutes instead and get a +6, or 60 minutes for a total of +11 ( 6 + 5 ).</p><h3>WAITING IT OUT</h3><p style="margin:0px;">By doing nothing, you can calm your nerves and let who you’re facing do the same. This can be by either finding a shadow to hunker down in or finding a spot in the wall where you can rest while climbing.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Using this tool allows you to half the current Soft Failures. You do roll 1 Stress Dice either way.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This may or may not work on an inanimate Obstacle but you need to use your best judgement.</p><h1>Skill Descriptions</h1><table

Add 1 to your roll for every Level of Fatigue your character has.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SPORT (specific)</strong> This covers the actually playing of a specific sport as well as an in-depth knowledge of the game’s rules and famous players and techniques. If it becomes a plot point, the GM should feel free to make this skill apply to only certain positions, like pitching or shortstop.</p><table style="width:260px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Move Silently Speed </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Dice to Roll On</td><td>Speed</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>d20!</td><td>Crawling/Strolling</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>d12!</td><td>Walking</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>d8!</td><td>Jog</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>d4!</td><td>Run</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>0</td><td>Sprint</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MOVE SILENTLY</strong> When you want to move silently, you’ll want to use this skill. This involves being able to feel your way along and compensate for creaks.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is always an opposed check vs any potentially listener’s Listening, with a failure indicating that the listener has heard something suspicious, though the person attempting Move Silently may not be aware that they were detected. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SWIMMING</strong> This skill allows a character to not drown in water. Without at least basic training in this skill, a character can’t attempt to swim with simply an Athletics check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The difficulty of the check is determined by the water (or other liquid, I don’t judge) you’re attempting to swim in, though simply trying to float on your back and letting the current take you reduces the difficulty by 2, though it is risky because you could get pulling into an aquifer and drowned that way or get pulled over a waterfall.</p><h3>LORE SKILL SUITE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This suite covers general knowledge, which is mostly academic in nature. Most of it is pretty heavy stuff but the basics are second nature or stuff that’s been picked up here and there.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ADMINISTRATION</strong> While they’ll never inspire the awe or respect that other leaders do, people who oversee the day to day functions of an organization keep the lights on so that others can make the speeches.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Administrators can make an Average skill check to gain a clue about an item the party might need on their adventure, or a Challenging one to retroactively remember that they did buy an item back at the market for just such an occasion.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each of these checks they make increases the difficulty of the next one by 1 step.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HISTORY</strong> Everyone knows certain large events, but few can tie those events into an overarching narrative and understand their effects on later events.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The History skill allows a character to not just recall events but also to link them to the present day, to certain traditions and rituals of a culture, or the behavior of certain members of a culture, giving insight on how to proceed.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LANGUAGE (specific)</strong> A character receives this skill for free in their native tongue at double their Rank in Lore and it allows them to speak and be understood by others with skill in that language.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Checks are only made when timing is critical, such as communication in a battle, or when understanding is key, such as when debating foreign policy.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If one of the characters is in a Social Conflict with another in a tongue that’s not their native one, that person can only bring in as many Characteristic Die per round as he has Ranks in that Language.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Additionally, when two native speakers are in a Conflict, the one with the higher Language Rank gains Leverage (see Applicable Skills in <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/8"]' [queryParams]='{ search : "YoumayrollaxFoPjkBsEi"}'>Chapter 8: Social</a> ). In case of tie, nothing happens.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Lore Skill Suite can’t be used in place of a Language Check for tongues you don’t know unless you have the Language Skill in a related Language. Using a real-world example, someone with the Language (Swedish) Advanced Skill couldn’t use the Lore Skill Suite to understand a person with Language (French) but could use it when talking to someone with Language (Norwegian) or Language (Danish). </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LAW (culture)</strong> This skill covers the intricacies of the legal system, including landmark rules and common punishments for common crimes. A character can make their case or find loopholes to exploit the legal system.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A character’s Lore skill can only be used to substitute in for their native culture but not others. If the character does wish to branch out, his mastery of Law for that culture starts at 0, as he must learn everything from the ground up. Diving more into his own culture’s laws (buying this Advanced Skill for his culture) uses the Lore skill as base, as per usual.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LITERACY (language)</strong> Unlike other skills, this skill can’t be attempted unless you’ve specifically bought this Advanced Skill and its mastery starts at 0. That’s right; every character starts illiterate.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This skill allows a character to read and write in a language’s alphabet, giving them the power to pen books and poems, or passive aggressive notes.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MATHEMATICS</strong> While this may seem like just a skill that allows you to be able to juggle figures and add totals and calculate the area of a circle like a huge nerd, Mathematics has a more practical use: correctly guessing distances.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While you can try to eyeball how far away something is, an Average Mathematics check allows you to do rough calculations, giving you the ability to know exactly what penalty you’re going to get for using a ranged weapon or whose going to be affected by the Area of Effect of a spell you’re going to cast.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MEDICINE</strong> With proper treatment and nursing, a wound that would lay you out for weeks, may only keep you down for a couple of days. This skill involves the knowledge of long-term care, when bandages should be changed, which poultices will have the greatest effect, and what minor surgeries need to be performed.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character with this skill can make a Check for a wounded person, added the Severity of any Wounds that he's treating to the opposing roll. So, if a person has a 5, 3, and 8 Severity Wound, he can make a Medicine Check vs d20+16 or he can choose not to treat the 8 Severity Wound and make a vs d20!+8. Success means that the person can take 1 day off the healing time for that Wound every time it drops a Severity.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, a success against a 5 Severity Wound means that is was treated properly and takes 10 days to completely heal ( 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 ) instead of the normal 15.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You may also increase the Difficulty modifier by half again as much - if you succeed, you take 2 days off per Severity. So, if you're against a d20!+9, you can make it a d20!+14 ( 9 + ( 9 / 2 ) ) for that bonus.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Additionally, a Check vs the Poison, Toxin, or Disease's Lethality allows character to reroll their save. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MONSTER CRAFT</strong> This Advanced Skill is under both the Lore and Survival Skill Suite but still counts as 1 skill, so you don’t have to buy it twice - they share their Rank. It simply represents the different ways that each Skill Suite approaches the craft.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Monster Craft gives you insight into the creatures that roam the Middle Realm. Starting with something simple, such as their name, and the progressively learning more and more about them, such as they’re are fundamentally two different types of Incorporeal Undead or that you can convince Demons to do things if you win a Conflict with them.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The knowledge should be fairly general - weaknesses or where they draw their power from, so it will never reveal anything meta such as what the monster’s attack or Vitality is but it can let you know if the creature is known for having a lot of Vitality or is good at hitting.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each Monster Craft check starts as an Average Skill Check and answers one question the player has on a success but each successive check on the same monster increases the difficulty by 2. On top of this, for rare creatures or hard questions, the GM may up the Difficulty as she feels is appropriate.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NATURE</strong> This area of study covers the topography of the Middle Realm. It’s forests and rock formations and biomes. It helps predict whether or not it’s going to rain or whether the next summer is going to be a hot one.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Predicting what’s coming in the next hour is a Trivial check, with the difficulty increasing by 1 for each time you double the prediction window. So, detecting the weather in the next 2 hours is Easy, while doing so in the next 16 hours is a Hard check.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RELIGION (cult)</strong> This skill acquaints the character with a knowledge of cults, their common Covenants and Miracles, as well as their hierarchies, means of advancement and important members.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> It also allows a character to gain a knowledge of their rituals and sacrifices, as well as the taboos of their clergy and how to appease their heavenly messengers and avenging angels.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The Religion Skill is taken for a single Covenant, but can purchased independently for different Covenants.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A character adds the tens digit of this skill to their chance of gaining Favor when making sacrifices to the god of that cult.</p><h3>STREETWISE SKILL SUITE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This suite covers knowledge that a character might pick on the street or in the school of hard knocks. While Lore is book smart, Streetwise is street smart.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CURRENT AFFAIRS</strong> A character with this skill is well informed about the day to day affairs of regional powers and men and woman of importance, their dealings and alliances, as well as their hatreds. He can pick out celebrities and know how and why someone got rich and famous. They can also use this skill to guess the Honor category of someone by watching how people react to them.</p><table style="width:330px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Deception Check </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Penalty</td><td>Leve of Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>0</td><td>White Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-1</td><td>Lie of Omission</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-2</td><td>Mostly True Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-3</td><td>Half Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-5</td><td>Mostly False Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-8</td><td>Absolute Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-13</td><td>Absolute Lie With Easy Evidence Against It</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DECEPTION</strong> This covers all sort of deception, where you want the person to believe opposite the truth, or, to put it simply, when you want to lie to them.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The level of difficulty to pull off a lie is based on how much of what you’re saying isn’t the truth, strictly speaking. This is always opposed by either the other character’s Deception or Perception but only if the character has reason to suspect that you’re lying to them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Even if you succeed, this isn’t a permanent way of changing their mind. New evidence presented to that person may cause them to rethink their opinion on what you tried to sell them so be careful about what falsehoods you spin.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FORGERY</strong> Mostly commonly used for creating fake currency, forgery is a skill that allows a character to reproduce something effectively and fool others. This skill acquaints the character with common forging techniques and knowledge with what possible agents will being looked for.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The forger must also have the appropriate corresponding Craft or Trade skill, so he can’t forge coins if he doesn’t have the Metalworking skill, though that’s within reason: a character forging an official passport with one at hand doesn’t need to have Literacy as he can just copy the letters, though he may also need to have Artistry (wood cutting) to create the heraldry on it, but someone trying to forge an official declaration from scratch does need to have the Literacy skill in that language plus Artistry (wood cutting).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Forgery is opposed by Perception, the applicable skill, or Forgery but only if the character looking has reason to suspect there’s something else. A lazy guard probably won’t check your passport too closely right before lunch, but a particularly astute one whose on the lookout for a promotion will, thus granting him a check. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GAMBLING/GAMING</strong> This skill doesn’t give the character a gift for winning games, just that he knows the rules and knows the odds, which could in turn lead to him winning the game. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INTUITION</strong> The ability to understand people and get where they're coming form can help you figure out what will and won't work with them better. A Trivial Intuition check allows the character to get a feel for how open a person would be to a Conflict over something or what would be definite dealbreakers. It doesn't reveal any of their Characteristics or their strengths as it's more of gut feeling than anything. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each check on the same person increases the Difficulty by 1. To gain this insight, they must either watch them for a total of 15 hours + 1 hour for every additional thing they wish to learn, or talk to them for 10 minutes + 5 minutes for every additional. You can speed up the learning process, but 1 hour or 5 minutes, respectively, but doing so also increases the difficulty by 1. This time doesn't have to be in one sitting or done purposeful and more represents the fact that the person making the check needs to be familiar with the person on some leve.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LISTENING</strong> While Perception handles the other senses, Listening has to deal with your character’s auditory senses. This goes beyond simply hearing something: listening allows the character to know when an otherwise innocuous noise is actually something to pay attention to though it might not always be apparent why at first. </p><table style="width:300px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="3" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Lock Picking </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Lock Penalty</td><td>Base Time</td><td>Time Off</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>0</td><td>1 Minute</td><td>1 Second</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-1</td><td>5 Minutes</td><td>5 Seconds</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-2</td><td>20 Minutes</td><td>30 Seconds</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-3</td><td>30 Minutes</td><td>1 Minute</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-4</td><td>45 Minutes</td><td>5 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-5</td><td>1 Hour</td><td>10 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Per -3 After</td><td>Add. +15 Minutes</td><td>10 Minutes</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LOCK PICKING</strong> It takes a lot more know how then you might think to pick a lock. The amount of time it takes to pick any lock is based on your skill level and the quality of the lock. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Subtract the Time Off x how much you succeeded your check by from the Base Time.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PERCEPTION</strong> This covers four of the five senses that a character has: sight, touch, taste, and smell. Technically, your character is always receiving inputs from these senses but Perception helps filter out the most important ones. Can he detect if there are orcs in the nearby bush? Can she taste the hidden poison in her drink before she swallows? These are all Perception checks</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Like Listening, sometimes Perception will help the character notice something that may be important, even if it’s not obvious why it’s grabbing your attention.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SLEIGHT OF HAND</strong> This skill covers all things that require you to do quick, delicate movements with your fingers. This may be slipping a card up your sleeve, picking a pocket, or doing cat’s cradle while bored.</p><h3>SURVIVAL SKILL SUITE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This suite covers everything that a character might need to survive in the wild; Knowledge of what plants to eat and the skills to hunt and breed animals.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BOTANY</strong> This gives a knowledge of what the herbs used in cooking, alchemy, and medicine look like in their natural environment and it allows you to identify their common uses.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Mostly, this is used for detecting poisonous plants, which is a Trivial check, but someone with the Medicine skill can also find any local plants that might help him in his cures with an Average check, lowering his Medicine check by 1 if succeeds.</p><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Camouflaging Objects </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Penalty</td><td>Size</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>0</td><td>Fine</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-1</td><td>Diminutive</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-2</td><td>Tiny</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-3</td><td>Small</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-5</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-8</td><td>Large</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-13</td><td>Huge</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-21</td><td>Gargatuan</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CAMOUFLAGE</strong> This involves more than just ducking behind a crate or sliding into the shadow of a doorway; the skill of camouflage represents a character’s ability to blend into their surroundings, given enough time and patience. It also always them to help others hide more effectively as well. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Assuming that the character has time and equipment to do so, a character gains his skill percentage in Camouflage to his Hiding temporary. Additionally, under the same conditions, he can also give this bonus to other’s Hiding checks.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When used to hide something in plain sight, like a cart, building, or weapon, he may roll a check based on its size.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FIRE BUILDING</strong> Against the cold, lonely nights out in the wild, there is only the fertility symbols you carve for yourself and the roar of the fire. This skill allows you to build one of those things: the fire.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Under normal conditions, it takes about 30 minutes and a Trivial check to setup and light a fire, assuming you don’t have to go far out of your way to find the wood.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FIRST AID</strong> This gives the character a crude understanding of battlefield medicine: making splints and staunching wounds.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character with this skill can make a Check for a person wounded in that last 30 minutes, added the Severity of any Wounds that he's treating to the opposing roll. So, if a person has a 5, 3, and 8 Severity Wound, he can make a First Aid Check vs d20+16 or he can choose not to treat the 8 Severity Wound and make a vs d20!+8. Success means that the person can take 1 level of Severity off those Wounds. So a 5 Severity Wound drops immediately to a 4 Severity Wound. You cannot go back and do a Check for a Wound that you skipped</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You have 30 minutes to preform First Aid Checks for a person, which each Wound taking 3 minutes to see to, if appliable. You may also increase the Difficulty modifier by half again as much - if you succeed, you hit 2 points of damage. So, if you're against a d20!+9, you can make it a d20!+14 ( 9 + ( 9 / 2 ) ) to heal 2 points of damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HANDLE ANIMAL (specific)</strong> This skill deals with the handling and care of a specific animal, from birth to the slaughterhouse. It also deals with training and common illnesses to make sure the stock is healthy and virile.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The base price of this skill is calculated towards domesticated animals. If the player wishes to learn how to deal with wild animals, this skill costs thrice as much to purchase.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HIDING</strong> This allows a character to make the most of a situation or environment to cloak themselves against prying eyes. This is always opposed by Perception, with the difficulty determined by the area. Character can also use this to instantly get an idea of how well they can hide in the given space.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MONSTER CRAFT</strong> This skill is the same as the Monster Craft under the Lore Skill Suite. Look there for details on it.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NAVIGATION</strong> Either using the stars or the position of the moons and sun, this character can track their way even through the most untamed wilderness without getting lost. It also allows them to tell the time.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Without proper equipment, a character can only give rough estimations of where they are, anchored on larger geographic feature (like mountains or rivers but not towns or roads) to the nearest 10 miles.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SCAVENGING</strong> There’s a gift in high speed appraisal. This is often used by those picking over battlefields for anything they could sell, but it’s also found a niche with adventurers who use it to find food and sustenance while traveling away from civilization.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A Trivial check tells a character which of two things considered is worth more. This can’t be used for coinage, but can be any other type of good. It also gives the character an idea of whether broken equipment can be reasonably salvaged.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This doesn’t give even a ballpark of what anything is worth but it only takes a few seconds of consideration. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SNARING</strong> This teaches the character how to properly create and place snares to trap smaller wildlife. It also gives some cursory knowledge on the best places to put them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A successful Trivial check nets 1 lbs of usable game meat at the end of the day, with the amount you can catch increasing by 1 for each additional difficulty.</p><table style="width:250px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Hunting Check </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Modifiers</td><td>Condition</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-8</td><td>Raining</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>3</td><td>Still Muddy Ground</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Heavy Foliage</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-3</td><td>A Day Difference</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-5</td><td>A Week Difference</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-1</td><td>For Each Day After A Week</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Each Person In The Pursued Party</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HUNTING</strong> Most of the time, you’re not going to down your query in one go, and so the hunt is on as your watch for subtle signs of their passing. While this skill was originally used to hunt wildlife, it has been repurposed by wardens and bounty hunters trying to capture the most dangerous game. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The base for a Hunting check is Average difficulty, however, a lot of different factors play into a hunt. Each condition either raises or lowers the difficulty by the noted amount. These are not all the conditions that come into play but it should give you a good base line.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> On a failure, the Tracker loses the trail for a number of days equal to the amount they failed by. They must double back and can try a second check after the time elapsed to see if they’ve found the trail again. Should they fail the second time, they’ve completely lost the trail.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If your query is actively trying to hide their tracks, it becomes opposed by the query’s Hunting skill. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>USE ROPE</strong> Covering all kinds of knots and bindings, the Use Rope skill is pretty self-explanatory, though it should be noted that you can also use this skill to get a sense of the tensile strength of a rope or how much you’re going to need for a certain job.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> To keep your players on their toes, I suggest you make the check, not when they tie the knot, but when it’s tested. </p><h3>TACTIC SKILL SUITE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Combat isn’t just about raw physical power, but more about how it’s directed and used. This Skill Suite deals with logistics and making the most out of what you have.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COMBAT STYLE (style)</strong> By studying the best tactics and how to fight in certain circumstances, a warrior can take advantage of his surroundings and combat styles emerge. Combat Styles can be anything but involve to parts: a situation and a metric. This situation is when the Combat Style is most effective. For instance, it can be “in the forest”, “fighting on rooftops”, “being outnumbered”, “being in a duel”, “fighting while prone”, etc.. Really anything (as long as your GM approves). The second part of the Combat Style is the metric is applied to. This can be anything you could normally specialize in. Both the situation and metric are selected at the time of purchase and cannot be changed.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If the situation is applicable, the character receives a +1 to that metric for every 2 Ranks of that skill he’s obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So a character with the Combat Style (unarmed fighting, attack) at 5 who gets into a tavern brawl gets a +2 to attack as long as he doesn’t draw his weapon and simply uses fisticuffs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Having a high Rank in Tactics doesn't automatically give you Combat Style bonuses under all circumstances and buying this skill for the first time starts it off at Rank 0, instead of the Tactic Suite's Rank. </p><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Distraction Check </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Penalty</td><td>Time</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>0</td><td>1 Second</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-2</td><td>1d2 Seconds</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-3</td><td>1d3 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-5</td><td>1d4 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-8</td><td>1d4!

Minutes</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DISTRACTION</strong> More than simply yelling “hey, look” at someone, the art of distraction is the art of holding people’s attention.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The amount of time that someone is delayed is based on the difficulty of the check and how bent on their current activity they are.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The time given below is the time between checks, however, each successive check gets 1 difficulty harder, with the same result. So, distracting someone for 1d3 minutes the first time is Average, but the next 1d3 minutes you’re trying to hold their attention is Challenging. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This skill is less effective when the person knows they’re in immediate danger. In this case, as long as they’re not actively engaged in melee with someone, the time is reduced to equivalent amount of seconds. So, a successful Challenging check only delays someone for 1d4 seconds instead. Each successive check gets 2 difficulties harder in these cases.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LEADERSHIP</strong> The difference between a leader and an administrator is that the latter gets stuff done and the former gets others to get stuff done but hooking into what they believe and how they view themselves. Assuming you have a willing audience, you may make an Average Leadership skill check vs a social characteristic you think the person or group might have. If you succeed the check and they have the characteristic you’re looking for (or close enough - you don’t have to be exact), you increase their Morale by a number of points equal to the maximum value of one of the dice of that characteristic. So, a 3d4 Trait will only net 4 points of Morale.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can increase the number of characteristics you’re aiming for by increasing the difficulty of the check by a like number, but the audience only gains the bonus from the largest of the characteristics.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>QUARTER MASTERING</strong> There’s an art to packing and making sure that everyone is well fed and prepared. If a the quartermaster is using a personal container of any kind, he adds 2S for each Rank he has in this Skill. Otherwise, he adds 1S per Rank. This also applies to any person he packs for. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RALLY</strong> When manure hits the windmill, no speeches or grand narratives will keep a person from bolting. Only the cold will of a competent commander can keep a battle from becoming a route. A captain who successfully makes a Check for someone who is currently over their Stress Threshold, heals that person a number of Stress equal to his Rank. This is opposed by the enemy captain, if appliable, and each Check against the same target increases the Difficulty by 1, regardless of whether it was successful or not.</p><table style="width:250px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Recruiting Check </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Modifiers</td><td>Location</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5</td><td>Captial (pop +200,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>Large City (pop +100,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Medium City (pop +15,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>0</td><td>Small City (pop +8,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-1</td><td>Large Town (pop +1,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-3</td><td>Medium Town (pop +500)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-5</td><td>Small Town (pop +20)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-8</td><td>Wilderness</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RECRUITING</strong> Knowing where to find the right person is a crucial skill for any long-term expedition. A character with this skill can find a random person willing to hire on with a Trivial check in a number of days equal to their roll.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Now, finding specialists or someone with a certain skill is another matter. Every additional criteria adds 1 level of difficulty to the search.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Where you’re looking also makes a difference, as well.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This doesn’t guarantee that the person found will take the job or doesn’t have some serious issues, like a crippling fear of dogs: it only guarantees that they have the skills you’re looking for and that they’re somewhat interested in being hired on. Pay and comfort make a lot of difference to a prospective hire.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RIDING</strong> This skill teaches a character how to maintain their stability while on horseback and making them capable of feats of equine prowess.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This skill covers both general riding technique and mounted combat. Rules for fighting from beast back are found in the Bonfire Advanced rules.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SIGNALLING</strong> This is the knowledge of how to communicate over long distances, either using semaphore, smoke signals, signal lamps, or horn blowing.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When using this means of communication, each side rolls a check based on how complicated the message is and how quickly they need to send it. Signaling is an ad hoc language with no grammatical rules or complicated tenses and so even at the best of times, only simple messages can be sent.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WARFARE</strong> The Warfare skill hands directing troops on the battlefield, weighing options and devising plans on the fly. Those with this skill can roll it to temporarily pause combat to ask one question and receive one answer from a specific member of the party, or to simply tell them something. On top of this, you can also use this, out of combat, to confer with players who’re characters are not present in the scene.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Checks start at Trivial but increase by 1 difficulty each time they’ve been rolled that combat.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Warfare also has additional benefits and uses that will be outlined in Crowns of Fire, the kingdom management and mass combat supplement for Bonfire Advanced.</p><h3>TRADES SKILL SUITE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This suite covers the crafting and creating skills. While there are a wide array and breathe of professions, this list is pared down to those areas of knowledge where the common man and the adventurer overlap in their needs.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>APPRAISAL (specific)</strong> It’s wise to know what something is worth before selling and buying it. This skill handles that and is taken for a specific type of good, such as books & scrolls, livestock, jewelry, arms & armor, and so on.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If a character has the appropriate skill covering the item he’s looking to sell/purchase, he can get within her roll, expressed at a percentage, of what the item is currently worth, with the Check based on how common the item is and how closely it relates to his skill’s focus.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Additionally, the character should get a bonus if he has any skill that’s applicable to the thing he’s purchasing.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ARTISTRY (specific)</strong> While some may not find the Fine Arts a worthy way to spend time, others may disagree. Artistry covers all artistic endeavors, including painting, sculpture, embroidery and anything else that is done for art’s sake.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COOKING/BAKING</strong> On the road, a hot meal can count for a lot. A character who has a hot meal subtracts 1 day off the amount of time it takes to heal their Stress per Stress, so, they’re able to heal 15 Stress in 120 days, instead of 105.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> On top of this, a character can prep otherwise unpalatable or poisonous food in such a way as to make the most of it, though it is a Challenging check to do so, meaning they can stretch rations for longer.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Unless the character is trying to prep a feast worthy of His Imperial Majesty, basic daily cooking only requires a Trivial check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CRAFT (specific)</strong> This skill covers any skill that makes something that isn’t noted here, such as carpentry, tailoring, basket weaving, pottery, etc.. The GM may adjust the price for a particularly difficult to master study.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LEATHERWORKING</strong> From the moment it leaves the beast to the moment the final touches are finished, leatherworking handles the process of making and crafting works from the hides of animals, including skinning and tanning. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MAINTAINCE</strong> The skill of tinkers and adventurers, this gives the person a general knowledge of easy and ad hoc fixes that can be done on the fly. The level of difficulty in repairing something is equal to the total penalty it gives, rounded up to the nearest dice size.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So repairing a spear with a -1 to Attack and Damage is Trivial (d4!), while repairing one with a -15 to Attack and Damage is Easy (d6!). </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>METALWORKING</strong> This covers the process of changing crude ore into a beautiful weapon, armor, or decorative piece. It also covers the construction and repair of more mundane things, like plows, but if you’re picking this skill up, I doubt you’re doing it to corner the farmer’s market.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MUSICIAN (specific)</strong> This covers the mastery of specific instrument, including singing. At the end of the day, the dulcet tones of a neatly played mandolin can ease the ache of a long day. A character who hears someone play an instrument subtracts 1 day off the amount of time it takes to heal their Stress per Stress, so, they’re able to heal 15 Stress in 10 days, instead of 15.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This doesn’t stack with others playing, however, and does no good if you’re in a stressful situation, like being hunted.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Unless the character is trying to serenade a queen, basic daily ditties only require a Trivial check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PERFORMANCE</strong> This skill covers everything from making your case before a court or a stirring speech before charging into battle. On a success, anyone listening gains a temporary d4 Devotion to what the performer wants: whether that’s themselves or an organization or a case. If the Devotion already exists, the size is temporarily increased. Additionally, the Devotion dice size can be increased 1 for every extra level of difficulty the orator passes their check by.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PERSUASION</strong> You may think that the truth is powerful enough to carry your argument but you can be beat out by a master of deception. Persuasion is the skill of rhetoric and formulating the truth in such a way that make it the most convincing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The level of difficulty to convince someone is how much evidence you can supply to back up your arguments. This is opposed by Deception or Persuasion but only if someone is trying to actively trying to deceive or convince the same person as you.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Even if you succeed, this isn’t a permanent way of changing a person’s mind. Others may lie more effectively than you can tell the truth and that may cause them to rethink their opinion on what you tried to sell them. </p><table style="width:500px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Persuasion Check </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Modifiers</td><td>Level Of Evidence</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>13</td><td>Amply Evidence Right At Hand, Backed Up By First Hand Experience</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>8</td><td>Amply Evidence Available But Not At Hand With Conviction, Backed Up By First Hand Experience</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5</td><td>Some Evidence With Conviction With First Hand Experience</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>3</td><td>Some Evidence With Conviction With Only Rumors</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>2</td><td>No Evidence But Conviction, Or Vice Versa.

For more information in what each Tradition specializes in, head over to <a [routerLink]='["chapter/11"]' [queryParams]='{ search : "WaysofshapinUXtuaHkzVF"}'>Chapter 11: The Weird</a>. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> The other thing it does is allow you to shape cantrip versions of spells from that Tradition, regardless of Archetype. The ability to shape is inherit in all living things though it takes decades of practice, a strong familiy bloodline, and/or a natural gift to do what Weird-Adept Archetypes do, a form of practical "folkweird" is often passed down as part of the tools of the trade. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> This doesn't, and will never, allow someone to shape the full version of a spell but it can give them a boost or an edge. The specific details should be left up to the GM and player but they should always be appropriate to the Tradition and never be more powerful than a spell that does the same thing. Most commonly this will mean it will get used as a Helper Skill. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Shaping a cantrip is still shaping and is stressful and so that anytime any of these Skills are used to shape, the shaper gets 2d6! Stress dice. </p><h5>Social</h5><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character is a multi-faceted representation of a fictional persona. She has her hopes and her dreams, her strengths and her weakness. All of these add up to hopefully make someone that has a compelling story of victory over her flaws, or defeat from the same. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> In game play terms, these are represented by 6 characteristics:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GOALS</strong> represent what your character is trying to achieve.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRAITS</strong> represent what sets your character apart from other characters.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PASSIONS</strong> represent interests and things that get your character’s blood pumping.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DEVOTIONS</strong> represent their relationships, either with people, organizations, or otherworldly powers.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>REPUTATION</strong> represent how other people see them - what are they rumored to have done or what kind of people do others think they are.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FLAWS</strong> are also considered social characteristics so they're back!</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These characteristics will be provided dice that will be used in social conflicts addressed below and represents how strong it is, with the bigger the dice, the better it is.</p><h1>Goals</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Characters can start with up to 3 Goals, but needs to have at least one at all times. They receive Experience and Honor, as well as increasing the other 3 social characteristics, as you progress along the path to completing them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> What does you character want? Why can’t they get it? These are the two fundamental questions that should be answered for each Goal. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Overlapping Characteristics</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You may think you’re pretty smart by having a Trait and Passion both be the same thing so that you always get to roll them at the same time. However, consider that you’re putting your eggs in one basket and it would be worth it to vary it a little to cover more bases, allowing you to use them more often and perhaps leveraging characteristics to bring in others.</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"> Ideally, they should include other party members and the overarching plot of the campaign. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> These goals can be anything from the incorporeal (“I want to find a home” or “I want to deal with this anger inside me”) to the very concrete (“I want to find my father’s sword” or “I want to stop this invasion”).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The best goals are those that are measurable and obtainable.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Being motivated by a Goal allows you to push yourself beyond what you thought was possible. When a Goal applies to a Conflict, you lower the dice size of any Repercussion Dice by 1.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Starting Characteristics</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> If you’re bringing in a new character to a new campaign, it’s highly probable that you won’t know what the game is going to be about, especially if the GM wants to keep it a secret.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> It’s perfectly acceptable to leave your Goals, Traits, Passions, and/or Devotions blank until you’ve got your feet under you but you should have at least a few Medium term goals and your strongest Trait filled out relating to your character’s personal arch. </p></td></tr></table><h1>Traits</h1><table style="width:350px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="6" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Trait Dice </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Charisma</td><td>Weak</td><td>Weak</td><td>Medium</td><td>Medium</td><td>Strong</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1 - 5</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d4!</td><td>2d4!</td><td>3d4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6 - 7</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d4!</td><td>2d4!</td><td>3d6!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>8 - 9</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d4!</td><td>2d4!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>10 - 11</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d4!</td><td>2d6!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>12</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d6!</td><td>2d6!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>13</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d6!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>14</td><td>d4!</td><td>d4!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>15</td><td>d4!</td><td>d6!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>16</td><td>d4!</td><td>d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>17</td><td>d6!</td><td>d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>18</td><td>d8!</td><td>d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>3d8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>19</td><td>d8!</td><td>d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>3d10!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>20</td><td>d8!</td><td>d8!</td><td>2d8!</td><td>2d10!</td><td>3d10!</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"> Traits are things that stick out about your character. Things that people tend to notice about them or that the character defines his identity by. These can be something specific (“I have blonde hair”) or something general (“I have an intimidating demeanor”) or somewhere in between (“I’m an orc”).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Traits don’t have to be physical in nature. It could be how your character views himself (“I’m confident” or “I’m good at math”). They can also be something about your character that he just can’t explain (“I’ve always been good with dogs” or “I can read people easily”).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The sky's the limit when it comes to Traits, so go wild, though they can't have exceptions. So, "I'm an angry person" works but "I'm an angry person but I don't let it affect my work" doesn't.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You start off with 5 Traits of varying levels: 2 weak, 2 average, and 1 strong. These are represented by dice of varying size. How strong these Traits are depends on your Charisma. So, if you have a 13 Charisma, you gain 5 Traits - two at d4, one 2d6, one 2d8, and one at 3d8</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While naturally Charismatic characters come out of the gate with strong personalities, as you adventure, your character will also grow and change, gaining and strengthening their Traits. This can be done by either increasing your Charisma, which also raises your Traits, or by buying Traits up directly.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Thinking of Traits</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> Thinking of Traits on the fly is hard. For new players, there's two ways of handling this: either picture a character from fiction you like or find interesting, and try to describe them. These are their Traits and you can crib off them to start with.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Or if you have no idea where to start or are just a risk taker, you can use the Trait Generator, which will give you a random Trait. These Traits may not always make sense but they can often serve as a jumping off point for your imagination.</p><p>You can find it in Chapter 9 on the Bonfire SRD</p></td></tr></table><h3>INCREASING TRAITS WITH CrP</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> If you want to increase your Traits further, you can spend CrP to give them a boost. This represents your character spending time developing their personality rather than spending time learning other things. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Increasing a Trait costs 10 + 4 for each time you've increased the dice. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can also buy new Traits for 10 CrP. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Please note that you can't buy a Trait past a d12 </p><h1>Racial Temperament</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Your Racial Temperament also tends to come into play fairly regularly during social situations. Like a Trait, you can add its dice in an Appeal. But what is the dice size? Well, it's your Honor Dice. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, basically, if your Racial Temperament applies, you get your Honor Dice that round. Pretty easy, pretty straightforward. </p><h1>Passions</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> What does your character do in their downtime? What’re their hobbies and what do they spend their time thinking about? These are their Passions.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You have a number of Passion Points from their Intellect that can be used to buy and increase your Passion for a subject. New Passions cost 12 points and start at a strength of 1. You can then spend 8 points to increase that by 1, but you can do this multiple times. You can also spend CrP as well.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Once per Conflict, if your Passion applies, you can increase a single dice size a number of times equal to that Passions strength. This can be done at any time during a Conflict and you don't have to spend all the increases form a Passion at one time. You can do this once for every applicable Passion but you can't use multiple Passions on a single dice. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you do spend a point to increase a die you've already rolled, you get to roll again, taking the second result, even if it's worse.</p><h1>Devotions</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> The final aspect are the Devotions that your character has. What relationships does he have? What organizations does your character associate with? Is he religious and, if so, is his loyalty more to his cult or to his god? How does he feel about that thing?</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Relationships between individuals don’t need to be reciprocal or even contemporary. A young fighter may be inspired by a girl who doesn't love him back or by a long dead king he greatly admires. These are still viable candidates for his Devotion.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Everyone receives two free Devotions: one to their character’s clan/family and another of their choice. Each Devotion comes with a "relationship verb" and the thing itself. So, his clan Devotion could be "Hate Clan" or "Have mixed feelings about Clan" or "Loyal to Clan"</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These Devotions start a 2.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Devotions are a more powerful driving force than other Characteristics, meaning that, if a Devotion applies, you automatically get 1 point for every point you have in it. So, if you approach a blood enemy, trying to convince him to help you, even if you’re being entirely reasonable, it’ll be much harder to do so.</p><h1>Reputation</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Reputation, in a nutshell, is what your character is known for and how other people see them. So, if you want to convince someone that you’ll keep your word, having a Reputation for doing so will help you out.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Reputation takes the form of 3 incomplete sentences starting with “I’m known for...”. Each time you level up, your GM will finish or change out one or more of those sentences and assign points to them that represent their strength. She’ll choose how to finish them based on how your character has been acting or the results of their actions.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">That’s right: just like in real life, you don’t really have control over your Reputation, though there is a way to influence it as you go.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In a Conflict, Reputation counts as a form of Evidence, but instead of getting the standard 3 points, you instead get the Reputation’s strength in points. It can be combine with other Evidence or as a d8 if you’re using it to make an Appeal.</p><h1>Flaws</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Let's circle back to Flaws because they are considered part of your Social Characteristics, after all, they make up who your character is as well. You start with your Flaws giving you 1d4! + your current total Stress you have in Social Conflicts should you bring them in. </p><h1>When To Use These Rules</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> These rules may not be appropriate to break out every time two people talk to each other, or even disagree on something. If you think your character can make a compelling argument that would convince an NPC to change his ways or give him a discount, don’t bother getting your dice out.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, if the GM thinks that what the player is asking isn’t probable, they can turn them away at the door. Sure, it’s possible that the blacksmith with give you that sword for free, but is it probable? Absolutely not.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> However, it is probable that he’s at least willing to give you a discount. The other person must also see a possible benefit to engaging with you.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, if you have a Conflict over a discount, that gives him a window to upsell you if you lose the Conflict. That might be worth it to him, while just having him give you the sword for away for free results in no Conflict unless the fighter convinces the blacksmith that the town is going to be shortly overrun by a goblin horde and that he needs a better weapon to fight them off, perhaps the blacksmith would be willing to part with the weapon for free, or maybe, if he's particularly stingy, he'd be willing to lend it to him temporarily for free. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And so setting the stage for a Conflict is often helping the NPC see what they could possibly get from you should they win.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Another way to start a Conflict is to get a person to act on their Characteristics, such as provoking a very aggressive person to attack you, or getting someone who is a soft touch to give you money. In that case, you simply state that, based on what you know about the person, they should probably act this way. If you're actually correct, you can start a Conflict with them. If you're wrong, you lose 1 Honor. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Other Reasons to Start a Conflict</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> There may be other reasons why you feel a Conflict is appropriate. This may be the case of a demon who forces his will on another’s demon or, in a more mundane case, in the case of someone who wants to tell the player a secret but also may not trust them entirely or doubt the wisdom of doing so.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There may also be certain circumstances where one person is forced into a Conflict, most often through magical means, but this is most often done as part of a plot point. More information is found in the Conflict as a Plot Point in Bonfire Advanced.</p></td></tr></table><h1>Starting The Conflict</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Most commonly, The characters have to decide what’s at stake; this is what they’re butting heads about and why they’re willing to put themselves on the line. More importantly, each side has to define what they want to happen to the stakes. If the stakes are high, this might change how much each side to willing to fight to get what they want or what tactic they’ll use to get it.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You also have to take into account what the other person is just straight up not willing to do. You can't convince a priest to desecrate the altar of his Divine, for instance, or someone to giveaway a family heirloom just because you want it. Additionally, both sides have to see some sort of benefit, should they win. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your GM has the right to simply say that an argument wouldn't work against someone and simply reject letting you put certain dice into your pool. So, for instance, you wouldn't get a Leverage die for having a hostage while having a Conflict with an orc who really doesn't care about the hostage's life, or you won't be able to bring in your Trait "I'm a gentle soul" to convince the hardened tyrant's heart by making a heartfelt plea for him to stop skinning all the children. </p><h1>Playing Out The Conflict</h1><p style="margin:0px;">The Conflict is done in a series of back and forths called “rounds”, in which each person is trying to get the other person to back down. This involves an argument-counterargument structure. A round starts when someone puts forth an argument and ends when the other person feels they’ve countered it or they’ve had to concede, so a round can be multiple exchanges but is commonly only a single back and forth.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The side who started the Conflict starts with 1 point, which isn't great because you want the lowest number of points, like golf.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Points come in two flavors: Evidence and Appeals.</p><h3>EVIDENCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Evidence is facts: things that are true, that both people know are true. These are flexes in power: I’m the king and so do you a favor if you do this for me. It can also be things you know about the other person, or subjects involved: if you know that a person is caring or has a temper, you can use that against them.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Conceding to Evidence gives you 3 points. Evidence is the surest way of convincing your opponent but it also tends to be more work: you have to know about your opponent and know their situation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Generally, this is signaled by placing a finger up in the air or pressing it against the table.</p><h3>APPEALS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Appeals are appeals to a person’s emotions, their sense of self, or their Honor. Traits often (but not always) used this way. It can sometimes be a jab at someone’s character or an insinuation of skill, through bragging about how good of a climber you are or maybe displaying your weapon in a threatening manner. It can also be how famous your character is.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Appeals vary in the number of points they get you. When presented against Evidence, the Appeal gives them as many points as dice you put up but you're considered to have conceded the point, giving you 3 points. You also get a d4! Repercussion Dice.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If, however, you meet Appeal with Appeal, then each person rolls the dice assigned to it. The person with the lowest total gets points equal to the number of dice the other side put up and sets aside a d8! for Repercussions, while the other person gets nothing and sets aside a d6!. This makes this a sound move for very charismatic people but it is still risky.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This is signaled by placing the dice in front of you, or holding them up, though you’re not obliged to reveal how many or their sizes.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Tracking Points</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Each side is responsible for their own points but to make it easier, you can use the E/A method. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Write an E and A on top of each other, and then draw a line between them. When you concede a point, put a tally next to the E. When someone loses a round with an Appeal, note how many dice are added by the A. When you're totaling your points at the end just multiple the tallies next to E by 3 and add that to the sum of the numbers by A. This should allow you to quickly jot things down and keep them straight during the Conflict. </p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Here’s some areas you can use to Appeal to your enemy and what their corresponding dice might be: </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HONOR </strong>Your standing can carry you through the day, even if your arguments are weak. The character with the highest Honor gets to apply a free use of their Honor die to their pool.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STRESS </strong>When your opponent is overworked and they're at maximum whelm, it's much easier to get them to give in. You can redeem a d4! worth of Leverage for every Stress penalty your opponent has, however, you don't have to redeem all the d4!s all in one round and can spread them out over the course of the Conflict.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EQUIPMENT </strong>It may be the case that equipment can sway an argument. Often this is through imitation or torture, but gold can also persuade a hesitant sellsword or the right equipment might convince a thief to take on a risky job. A badge of authority may also win you some influence.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Equipment used for this purpose gains the character a base d8. Equipment that’s substandard or that’s being re-purposed from its original use (a knotted rope used to whip a victim or a broken glass bottle used to threaten someone) only nets a d4.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STAT SOCIAL DIE </strong>Having an exceptionally high Strength or Dexterity might be relevant to the situation. If that’s the case, add that Abilities Social Die to your pool.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>APPLICABLE SKILLS </strong>You may roll an additional die for any applicable Advanced skill based on that Skill’s Rank. Take the Rank of that Skill and round up to the nearest dice size. So a Rank 5 Skill would net a d6 dice while a Rank 14 Skill would net a d20.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But that is by no means a comprehensive list and plays should be rewarded for out-of-the-box thinking. Appeals start at a d4!, but this can vary. For instance, a very skilled swordsman with a lot of Advanced Training in his weapon of choice makes a more powerful Appeal than a rookie. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can use the same Appeal multiple times during a single Conflict.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Characteristic as Evidence vs Appeals</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There’s no hard rule that can be given of when a Trait qualifies as one over the other, but there are some guidelines.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Generally, if the person whose Characteristic is being used is not directly involved and they’re known by both parties, it is Evidence.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If, however, one of the people is involved in the argument, especially if it is defense, or you’re trying to bring in the Characteristic of someone that the other person doesn’t know, then it is considered an Appeal. </p></td></tr></table><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Evidence as an Appeal</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Truthfully, there may be a time where you have Evidence but it's in your best interest to reinforce the idea with emotion that makes it closer to an Appeal than Evidence. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In this case, you treat the Evidence as an Appeal with a base dice pool of your Intellect or Charisma's Social Die, a dice from your Persuasion Skill (if you don't have that skill, you don't get this dice), and a d12! for the argument itself. From there, you can add other Characteristics to the pool. </p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The GM can say no to a proposal if the counter argument doesn’t directly relate to the argument, so careful phrasing could limit what your opponent can do. This is usually the indication that the round isn’t finished yet and the person who was rebuffed can try a different tact or argument.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Bluffing, or in other words, Lying</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">As per normal, a character only needs to roll a Deception Check if the other person is suspicious of them, but even then, if one side accuses the other of something, trying to get them to reveal a secret, they can use Deception to try and bluff, hiding their actual reaction.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the person is, in fact, telling the truth but someone is still suspicious of them, they’d roll a Persuasion Check to convince their accuser of their sincerity.</p></td></tr></table><h3>ENDING THE ROUND</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Both sides putting up relevant Evidence is countering the argument and means that neither sides could gain points.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If one side conceded, that means they don’t really have anything to counter it (either through Evidence or an Appeal) and so they get points as noted above.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These points are kept secret until the end of the Conflict.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Multiple People in a Conflict</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can, of course, have people help out in a variety of support roles during a Conflict but they can often trip over each other, giving the opposition a chance to rebuttal.</p><p style="margin:0px;">While making an Appeal, everyone rolls separately, totaling their results. If this beats the opposition, however, they only gain points equal to the person that rolled the least amount of dice.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, if you have 3 people, who roll 7, 5, and 1 dice, and they beat the opposition, they only get 1 point.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The opposition also adds one instance of their Charisma Social dice for each person opposing them.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If, however, the company is presenting Evidence, it pretty much works the same, however, if multiple players present multiple pieces of Evidence, the opposition is only obliged to counter one of them to get points and the company only gets the points for one Evidence.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, if one of the players points out that the person was found at the scene of the crime with the bloody dagger in his hands (a point that the opposition has no counter for) and the other says that the person was also said that the person’s alibi was disapproved by an associate that ratted him out, the opposition only needs to reply that his associate was clearly lying to get a more forgiving sentence (which is technically a half-truth). </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Both sides would only get 3 points from that exchange.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Players may take sidebars, of course, (See the Taking a Break Sidebar below) but they may also use the Warfare Advanced Skill to temporarily pause and discuss with each other.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you’re facing multiple people, note that any Evidence has to apply to/be believed by everyone on the opposition to be effective, thus making Evidence less and less helpful in a situation where you have to convince a group or mob.</p></td></tr></table><h3>TRUMP CARDS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">There are some arguments that are so good that they can counter multiple points. These are considered trump cards and should be played carefully because they can only counter arguments that your opponent has already put forward.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Trump cards give a number of points equal to their base times the number of points they counter. So, if you put forward Evidence that counters 3 arguments, it would give the other 9 points, while having a 4 dice Appeal that counts the same number gives you 12 points.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">It doesn’t matter if the arguments have already been counter, in fact, that’s when you get the most benefit out of trump cards.</p><h3>PUSHING THE POINT</h3><p style="margin:0px;">When one side feels they may have the upper hand and that the other has run out of arguments, they can try to push the point, or end the Conflict. He simply tries to push the other side to make a decision.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If it turns out that the other person does still have more to say, the Conflict continues and the pushing person gains 1 point.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If, however, it turns out that the pushed person does, in fact, have no more to say, than the Conflict ends</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Taking a Break</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">It may take days or weeks to sway someone, making sure you know them, their likes and dislikes, and that you’ve got all your bases covered.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In this way, it is perfectly acceptable, should it make sense, that you suspend the Conflict, possibly indefinitely.</p></td></tr></table><h1>Ending The Conflict</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At the end of the Conflict, both sides reveal their points. The one with the least points gets their way.</p><h1>Repercussions Of A Conflict</h1><p style="margin:0px;">Anyone with dice set aside from using an Appeal now rolls them. Total the results.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If the total is less than or equal to 8, the character suffers only a short-term effect and takes that total in Stress from the encounter.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the total is greater than that, the character gains that total in Stress and suffers a long-term effect. Choose one of the following:</p><ul><li>Reduce the dice size of one of their Traits, Passions, Devotions by 1</li><li>Lose a dice from one of their Traits</li><li>Lose a Trait, Passion, or Devotion</li></ul><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you rolled any 1s, the character is also changed for the better. It doesn’t matter how many 1s you roll, you only choose one of the following:</p><ul><li>Gain a Passion, Devotion, or Trait at d4</li><li>Add a dice to one of their Traits</li><li>Receive a temporary d20! to your next conflict. You may gain an additional dice per extra 1 you rolled</li><li>Increase the dice size of 1 of their Characteristics by 1 for each time you rolled a 1 on your Stress Dice, up to the number of dice associated with that Characteristic and up to a d12!.</li></ul><h5>Combat</h5><h1>Starting A Combat</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Combat engages as soon as both sides are within eyesight and both know they the other intends harm.</p><h3>The CLOCK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Clock begins at 1, and then progresses to 2, 3, 4 etc, ad infinitum. When the Clock matches a character’s Initiative, they go. Each of these numbers represent 1 second of time passing. What second a character's next action is referred to as their initiative (or "where they are on the Clock") </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This can be a difficult when you first start so we recommend that you start with only running a two or three enemies until you get the hang off it. We've also provided a tool that can help you keep track of the Clock and enemies easier. You can find it <a href="https://combatcounter.dragon-slayer.net/">here</a>.</p><h3>STARTING INITIATIVE & SURPRISE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each side rolls an initiative die. The lower the die, the more prepared they are for the attack, though typically the instigator goes on second 1. Those that know the battle is about to start (like being warned by a predetermined sign) use a d4, and the completely surprised receive a d20, while everyone else typically falls on a dice between that. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Those whose initiative hasn’t come up are surprised and continue to do what they were doing as if nothing is wrong. They can take no other actions: they’re completely unaware of what’s going on.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Should someone attack them during this time, they are completely helpless, defending on a d8!.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If the surprised person is hit, the pain quickly brings them into the reality of the situation and they may act 2 seconds later (or before that if their initiative was the next second). </p><h3>ACTIONS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Every action takes a certain amount of time. On a character’s Initiative, they declare their action and are told how long that action will take. After that time, the action is complete.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, if a character wants to walk across a room, which will take 8 seconds, and his Initiative is 5, once the Clock reaches 5, he starts walking and once it reaches 14, he’s gotten the other side of the room. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At any point, you may choose to forfeit your action and change your course. If, when half way across the room (at second 9), the character sees that his buddy is in trouble, he can immediately decide that, no, he’d rather be there, his character stops walking across the room and instead heads over to help his friend. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Keeping track of this can be tricky for new players unused to the system. To help players make the shift, we've created the <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SdyiHUEmgYOpuB6sl5ahDY_KcYbvDl8-/view?usp=sharing">Basic Combat Cheat Sheet</a> that has a strip where you can keep track of when your next action is going to happen. It also includes handy references to other rules found in this chapter as well.</p><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Movement </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Category</td><td>Speed</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Crawl/Stroll</td><td>2.5 Ft/sec</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Walk</td><td>5 Ft/sec</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Jog</td><td>10 Ft/sec</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Run</td><td>15 Ft/sec</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Sprint</td><td>20 Ft/sec</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MOVEMENT</strong> While, for the most part, you’ll be using your commonsense to determine how long things will take, to unify at least one thing, movement rates are given below.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A person may move up 1 movement category or down 2 in a second.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Running can be kept up for 5 Seconds + Endurance Rank. If you continue to Run after that you take d4 damage at the beginning of every 5 Seconds + Endurance Rank period..</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Sprinting can be kept up for Endurance Rank - Stress Penalty in Seconds. If continue to Sprint you take d4! damage at the beginning of every Endurance Rank - Stress Penalty period.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If you take damage from Running or Sprinting, you can’t Run or Sprint again until you take a breather.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Also, moving from a Run to Sprint, or vice versa, doesn’t reset that count, so don’t think you can skip taking damage by moving from a Sprint to a Run, you cheeky devil.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While Running or Sprinting, you're unable to attack or defend yourself</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Tracking Initiative</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Until you get the hang out it, it might be difficult to keep track of when exactly things are happening, which is why we've provided the combat strip on the <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SdyiHUEmgYOpuB6sl5ahDY_KcYbvDl8-/view?usp=sharing">Basic Combat Cheat Sheet</a>, which is that numbered line on the left hand side going 1 to 20. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">To use it, take a marker (dice or a penny works just fine) and place it on your initiative. When that number comes up on the Clock, you do your action and then add the seconds until your next action, looping back around to 0, if needed. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if you attack on second 17 with a weapon with a recovery of 8, place a marker on 17. When the Clock gets to second 17, you attack, and then move the marker to 3 ( since 17 + 8 is above 20, you subtract 20 from it). </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You may also find it useful to place markers for another things you want to track, like movement and shooting for ranged fighters or when spells will go off or end. </p></td></tr></table><h1>The Combat</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> It is inevitable that if you get into combat, you’ll end up engaged in a melee with your enemy.</p><h3>ZONES of ENGAGEMENT: MEASURING YOUR OPPONENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are 3 positions that you can have relative to your enemy. These positions aren’t reciprocal by nature: you can be threatened by someone and not have them be threatened by you.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NOT ENGAGED</strong> This is basically the default. You are too far away for them to reasonable do anything.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>THREATENED</strong> This means that you’re within 5 feet + your opponent’s weapon’s measure. From here, if you move faster than a Jog and if they’re within half their weapon Recovery, they can attack you. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> If you go from Engaged to Threatened, your weapon initiative doesn't reset, so if you become Engaged again for any reason before your weapon's Recovery, you may not attack. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ENGAGED</strong> You’ve closed the distance and can actually make an attack. The person with the highest weapon measure attacks first. If both weapons are exactly the same measure, the attacks happen simultaneously.</p><h3>MELEE ATTACK & DEFENSE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Basic melee attacks always roll a base d20! + any attack modifiers, while defenders either rolls a d20! + any defense modifiers</p><h3>RANGED ATTACK & DEFENSE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Ranged attacks and defenses function identical to melee attacks and defenses (including Flanking), only get a few additional bonuses and penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The first is that range (of course) and the second is movement. When defending against a ranged attack, you get a +2 for each Movement Category above standing still. So, if you're getting shot at, get the lead out. </p><h3>DEALING DAMAGE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Once both sides have rolled and added all modifiers, compare the totals against each other.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If the defender’s is equal to or greater than the attacker, the attack misses.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PARRYING</strong> If a melee attack roll is within the Parry Threshold of the defender’s total, the defender may choose to deflect some of the incoming attack.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The attacker rolls their damage and subtracts the shield or weapon’s DR and then their armor’s DR. Any left over is still done to the defender. For piercing weapons, the /d DR of the shield or weapon is tripled. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, a defender with a Parry Threshold of 4, and a total of 10 for their defense roll vs an attack roll of 14, could choose to parry the blow, taking less damage.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> However, if it’s not, the attack lands and the attacker rolls his weapon’s damage die and adds any appropriate damage modifiers. The defender than subtracts their Damage Reduction and the remaining total is subtracted from their Vitality and added to their list of wounds.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DAMAGE REDUCTION</strong> Armor allows you to reduce the amount of damage taken. This is often times shorted to DR. There are two types: Static, noted by just a number, and Per Die, noted by a number /D.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Static simply subtracts that number from the damage and is done.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> /D subtracts that number multiplied by the number of dice the attack is using. So, if someone is attacking you with a slashing weapon (2d6!), and you have armor that gives you 4/D, you’d subtract 8 from the damage. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Either way, if the attacker chooses to remain in engaged, he then adds his weapon’s Recovery to the current second on the Clock. Once the Clock reaches that new number, he may attack again. </p><h3>KNOCK-BACKS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the pre-DR damage is higher than your enemy’s Vitality Size Modifier + 3 for every level of Encumbrance you have, the attack also moves them back 5 feet. If it’s twice the damage needed, they get knocked back 10 feet, and so on.</p><h3>VITALITY & DAMAGE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Remember that if you drop a Vitality Category you gain Stress equal to your Encumbrance</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At each wound category above Unharmed, a character automatically receives 1 level of Fatigue. So a character whose Wounded is fighting with a penalty of 4 to his Recovery, Defense, Damage, Attack, Fatigue Score and Skill Checks (assuming he isn’t Fatigued from doing anything else in the fight).</p><h3>TRAUMA</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> If someone does enough damage in one hit for you to skip a Wound Category (25% of their Vitality), you’ll have to roll a Trauma check, which is a Con check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Failure means that your character has been overcome with pain to the point that he’s unable to act, leaving him completely defenseless for a number of seconds equal to how much he failed by times 3.</p><h3>COUP de GRACE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A helpless enemy is one completely at your mercy. If a character is completely helpless, either from failing a Trauma check, being bound, or deep asleep, a character can kill the target instantly. This move takes 10 seconds to complete as it takes a bit of positioning to pull off. The character’s who throat is being slit gives out a cry of pain as they expire.</p><h3>FACING & FIGHTING MULTIPLE PEOPLE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> The likelihood is that at some point you’ll want to be flanking or someone with want to flank you, to try and gain an advantage.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Defending right in front of you is pretty easy and so brooks no penalties, however, every 45 degree off that the defender lowers their Defense dice by 1 size, with those being attacked from directly behind defend on a d8! since they take advantage of a huge blind spot.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This penalty can be mitigated through the use of shields. Small shields allow you to defend against an additional assailant, depriving them of that bonus, while Medium and Large ones allow you to defend against an extra 2 and 3, respectively.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A maximum of 8 people at a time can effectively attack person at once, assuming that they’re out in the open. After that, every assailant’s attack die is lowered by 1 size per extra person.</p><h3>TACTICS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> These rules add another layer of strategy to combat and should be implemented as soon as you have the basics down.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A combatant utilizing these moves can only commit to one at a time, unless otherwise stated and can only switch on their attack unless it says otherwise.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ACTIVE DODGING</strong> This move relays on actively focusing on dodging against incoming attacks.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A defender commits to how much he wants to focus on dodging incoming attacks, both melee and ranged, choosing from a bonus to his defense in the range of +1 to +5, but netting an equal penalty to his attacks (-1 to -5).</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, this lowers the range for Near Perfect Defenses by 1, so you score them on a base natural 18 - 19. This tactic needs to be committed to for at least your full weapon Recovery. After that you may continue using it and change tactics at any point.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> But focusing on defense does slow you down, since you're zigzagging and trying to juke out your enemy, so your movement is considered 1 Category lower for how far you move. So, if you're Medium sized and Active Dodging while at a Run, you would move at 10 ft / sec, instead of 15. You would still be subject to the damage, however, since you're still technically running. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Active Dodging can be combined with Retreat and Step Back, adding only the attack penalties but gaining all auxiliary benefits from each (so no, the defenses don't stack).</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BRACE YOURSELF</strong> Maybe you look at your opponent and say "No, you move". You root your stance and ready yourself, sacrificing some maneuverability to hold the line and get a better chance of striking first.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> While using this Tactic, a character adds +15 to their Knock-Back Threshold and gains a +1 to their Measure, however, they defend on a d12!. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CHOKING UP ON YOUR WEAPON</strong> When you’ve choked up on your weapon, your weapon’s Measure is halved, and you add that number, rounded down to its Recovery. Your halved Measure is considered your new Measure for determining who attacks first and what Tactics can be employed on you as well.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> However, if an opponent is In Your Guard and you choke up on your weapon, you defend with a standard 1d20! and deal full weapon damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You’re unable to employ this tactic twice if someone again gets within your guard.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FEINT</strong> When performing this move, you (hopefully) get your enemy to commit his guard to a different location than you plan on hitting. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Before you roll, if you declare a Feint, you receive a +5 to that Attack but receive a -3 to Defense until your next attack. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FEND OFF</strong> If your weapon's measure is at least 1 foot greater than your opponent's, you can try and fend them off. This means that you may attack them freely, while they can't do the same to you.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You may only use this Tactic as someone is going from Threatened to Engaged, in which case they're automatically considered to be Fended Off. To full becoming engaged with you, they'll have to knock your weapon aside with a regular attack that deals no damage. Should they hit, they become fully engaged and can attack freely again. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IN THEIR GUARD</strong> If you're engaged with a person and have a weapon that is at least 1 foot shorter than your opponent, you may attempt to get in their guard. On a successful attack that deals no damage, the shorter weapon fighter has successfully knocked his foe's weapon aside and is no fighting at extreme close range, cause them huge penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The longer weapon may only defend with a d12!. All damage dice is also reduced by one size (3d4! → 3d3!). They may, in turn, employ the Choke Up On Your Weapon Tactic.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LONG GUARD</strong> By placing your weapon further out in front of you and trying to line the body of the weapon with the defender’s eye line, this may allow a person with a short weapon the first strike.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> While using this tactic, you increase your weapon’s measure by 1/2 ft but you reduce your damage’s largest die by 1 size.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Crushing weapons are unable to employ this tactic.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>POWER ATTACK</strong> This is the fighting equivalent of baseball batting your enemy, swinging with all your might.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> With this attack, you receive a -3 to your Attack and next defense but your damage increases</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Piercing weapons increase 1 die by 1 size. Slashing weapons increase all dice by 1 size and crushing weapons increase its highest die by 2 sizes.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RETREAT</strong> This is a defensive tactic that involves moving directly back at jog or at a 45 degree angle from your opponent’s blows at a walk.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> After your defense roll, if you declare a Retreat, you receive a +5 to your next Defense roll but also a -5 to your next Attack and must continue to move back until your next attack, either at a jog, if moving directly back, or at a walk, if started to move at a 45 degree angle.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If your opponent is using the Flurry of Blows, Feint, or the Power Attack tactic, if they do hit, you only receive half damage</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHIFT</strong> You move at your walking speed to either side of your opponent, but suffer a -1 to your next Attack and Defense for every 5 ft you travel before your next Attack or Defense. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> However, if you Shift with another tactic, you don’t receive this penalty and gain a +2 that can be either used to increase a bonus or decrease a penalty from that tactic. You may do this freely with any tactic except Retreat and Step Back.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Shifting is also used to change Facings so if you’re engaged with an enemy and you Shift. And don’t forget that you get those tasty bonuses from flanking your enemy if they don’t also Shift to face you.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STEP BACK</strong> This is a defensive tactic that involves moving directly back from your opponent’s blows at your walking speed.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Before your defense roll, if you declare a Step Back, you receive a +5 to your next Defense roll but on your next attack roll shrink the damage of your dice based on its type and must continue to move back at a Walking speed until your next attack.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Piercing weapons lower 1 of their dice by 1 size. Slashing lower all dice by 1 size and crushing lowers their highest die by 2 sizes.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If your opponent is using the Flurry of Blows, Faint, or the Power Attack tactic, if they do hit, you only receive half damage.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Retreat v. Step Back</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While they may seem similar on the surface, these two different tactics have some key differences I thought I’d point out so that you can utilize each better.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> 1. Step Back must be declared before you roll your defense while Retreat can be declared after, meaning that if you see you rolled low before employing them.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> 2. Step Back moves your character straight back, while Retreat allows you to move up to 45° to the left and right, meaning that if you’re going to be backed against a wall, it’s an option to try and skirt your opponent.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> 3. Retreat may be done at a jogging speed, while Step Back is always at a walk.</p></td></tr></table><h3>BLEEDING OUT & DYING</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A character falls into the Bleeding Out Wound Category is unconscious and is in danger of dying. This is played out like a Social Conflict, with the person fighting against Death for survival, Appealing to him to let him live.</p><p style="margin:0px;">However, this has a few changes from a standard Conflict, the first is that each round happens every 5 seconds that the character is in this state. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The second is that you won’t be counting points: it’ll only matter if you win or lose the round. Every time you lose, you bleed out more and take an additional point of damage; every time you win, you get closer to stabilizing.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Getting to half your Constitution in the negative (either from bleeding out or from additional wounds) results in the character's death but getting 10 points means that that stabilize, losing no more Vitality but still remaining unconscious until they're brought back up to Wounded.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Conflict is mainly going to be Appeals, with Death rolling 5d4! to start with. Each successive round the player wins, Death increases the size of his dice. When the player fails a round, Death's dice drop back down to 5d4! again.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Other characters can add their Medicine Skill as an additional dice each round, but not First Aid, though First Aid can bring someone back up to Wounded and just stop the Conflict in its tracks anyway so there's that.</p><h1>Ending Combat</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Combat ends when one side is incapacitated, reached a truce, or have fled the field. At that point the Clock stops and play moves back to narrative time. </p><h1>Trainings</h1><h3>ARMOR BASIC TRAINING</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This basic training allows a character to more effectively utilize armor of different types based on their level of familiarity with them. It’s split into 3 categories:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LIGHT (15 CrP)</strong> This covers armor that tends to not to restrict the wearer so is often favored by skill centric characters.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MEDIUM (10 CrP)</strong> This armor is a bit heavier than Light armor and offers a tradeoff between protection and mobility.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HEAVY (10 CrP)</strong> The armor in this category is durable, thick, and heavy, able to withstand blows but at the cost of being hard to move in.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You have to buy armor training in sequence, starting at Light and moving all the way to Heavy.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can always try and use armor without the baseline knowledge of how to properly wear and don it, but the Defense penalty and Encumbrance are both doubled if that’s the case.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can further your training in armor to increase the benefits. See the Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training Sidebar for more details.</p><h3>SHIELD BASIC TRAINING</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> For 10 CrP, this teaches a character the basic understanding of how to properly use and employ shields in combat. This training covers all types of shields.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can always try to use a shield without the training; however, you gain a -4 to your defense when doing so.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can further your training in shields to increase the benefits. See the Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training Sidebar for more details.</p><h3>WEAPON BASIC TRAINING</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> By gaining the basic understanding of how a weapon is wielded, used and taken care of, you not only expand its longevity, but also your longevity on the battlefield.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Weapon training costs 10 CrP and is taken for individual weapons, however its benefits extend to weapons of that share similar features.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A person completely untrained in weapons both Attacks and Defends with that weapon using a d12!. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> However, one trained uses a d20! Attack and Defense (depending on whether or not they use a shield). </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, this is extended to any weapon that shares similar qualities.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A character with training in both a Melee and Ranged weapons, gains that training to all weapons. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, why would you take training in multiple weapons once you have one melee and one ranged? Because this training allows you to further master that weapon, increasing its usefulness.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can further your training in weapons to increase the benefits. See the Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training Sidebar for more details. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Minimum Weapon Recovery</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> How fast a weapon can move and maneuver is ultimately limited by its size and balance and no matter how much you train, you can’t overcome that hurtle. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Small Melee Weapons: 2 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Medium Melee Weapons: 3 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Large Melee Weapons: 4 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Small Ranged Weapons: 3 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Medium Ranged Weapons: 4 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Large Ranged Weapons: 5 Seconds</strong></p></td></tr></table><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Trainings are further training in those particular fields, like the name implies. They can only be taken for things that you already have Basic Training in.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Each of these types of Training has two things: Tiers, which represent how broad your knowledge is (sort of like Suite Suites and Advanced Skills), and Ranks.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Every type will also have areas you can specialize in. These are the same across the Tiers of that type of Advanced Training but you train in specific Tiers. So, Armor Advanced Training has Defense, Recovery Modifier, Encumbrance, and Initiative as its areas. Each purchase in that area gives them a Rank in one of the Tiers, which is a bonus that’s applied when applicable. This bonus can't bring a negative bonus above 0, however.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The price for increasing your Rank in an area is that Tier’s Cost + twice the current Rank. </p><table style="border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td> </td><td>Rank 1</td><td>Rank 2</td><td>Rank 3</td><td>Rank 4</td><td>Rank 5</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Def</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Init</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Recovery</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Encumb</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can’t buy up a Rank again for a given Tier until you’ve either filled out all the rest of the areas for that Tier or you have two areas in that Tier at the current highest Rank. This is true all the way down so your Advanced Training forms a weird looking triangle (as shown to the left). This is true even if you have reached the maximum benefit from an area.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tiers don't stack with each other: you gain all the bonuses from a single Tier of your choice. If you have a +1 Attack and Damage in all melee weapons and a +1 to Defense and -1 to Recovery in polearms, while wielding a pike, you either gain the +1 Attack and Damage with it or +1 Defense and -1 Recovery, but not +1 Attack, Damage, Defense, and -1 Recovery.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Bonuses cascade down through tiers but only if they’re applicable.</p><h3>COST</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Base Costs are listed next to each tier. The number in parenthesis is what Fighter Archetypes pay instead. </p><h3>ARMOR</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 3: All Armor</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 2: Armor Type (Light, Medium, Heavy)</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 1: Specific Armor (Gambeson, Scale, Maile, etc.)</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AREAS</strong> Defense, Recovery Modifier, Encumbrance, Initiative </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Encumbrance lowers that armor's Encumbrance by 2 for every plus you have in it.</p><h3>SHIELDS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 3: All Shield</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 2: Shield Size (Small, Medium, Medium)</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 1: Specific Shield (Buckler, Kite, Round, etc.)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AREAS</strong> Defense, Parry, Encumbrance, Breakage</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Encumbrance lowers that shield's Encumbrance by 2 for every plus you have in it.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Breakage increases each Shield Breakage Threshold by 2 points for every rank obtained. So, wielding a shield with 2 ranks in this area of Mastery means that your shield can take 19 points of damage before saving vs d20!+10, 24 before saving vs d20!, and 29 before saving vs d20!-10. This mastery doesn't affect weapon breakage.</p><h3>MELEE WEAPONS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 3: All Melee Weapons</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 2: Weapon Type (Sword, Polearm, Trauma, etc.)</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 1: Specific Weapon (Arming Sword, Handaxe, Mace, etc.)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AREAS</strong> Attack, Damage, Parry, Recovery</p><h3>RANGED WEAPONS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 3: All Ranged Weapons</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 2: Firing Type (Thrown, Mechanical, Firearm)</p><p style="margin:0px;">Tier 1: Specific Weapon (Sling, Longbow, Throwing Axe, etc.)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AREAS</strong> Attack, Damage, Recovery</p><h5>Equipment</h5><p style="margin:0px;"> Now it’s time to kit out your character and get them suited up to hit the road. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Most things won’t warrant an explanation but some have been provided for further clarification.</p><h1>Encumbrance</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> You’ve probably noticed that Carry under your Strength Stat is just a string of numbers and letters and you probably wondered: what does that mean? Well, I’m about to tell you.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Instead of each item having a weight in pounds or ounces, each item is assigned a size that represents, not only how much it weighs, but also its general bulky and awkwardness. These sizes correspond to the naming conventions set up in <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/14"]' [queryParams]="{search: 'sizingandsizercharhear'}">Chapter 14: Misc Rules</a> however, just because something is Medium sized here, doesn’t mean it’s the size of a human - again, item sizes are based on their weights, bulkiness, and awkwardness to carry.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Your Carry matches up with that, so if you have 2M as your Carry, you can carry 2 Medium items - or 2M items.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You can also swap out 1 for 3 of the size lower. So instead of carrying 2M items, you could carry 1M item and 3S items.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each individual instance of an item counts towards this: carrying two daggers, both S items, would count as 2S for Encumbrance.</p><h3>WEARING CLOTHES, ARMOR, & PERSONAL CONTAINERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Normally what is written under the Carry column for each item is its Encumbrance. The only exception is clothes, armor, and personal containers. If worn on your person, not carried or stuffed in a backpack, these become less encumbering since their weight is distributed across basically the entire body.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In this case, shrink them 1 size for Carry purposes. Small items become negligible. Wearing boots, a Small item, then makes them effectively weightless, while any Heavy Armor makes them only M.</p><h3>PERSONAL CONTAINERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Personal Containers, such as backpacks or sacks, go one step further. Since it is assumed that your Carry weight is how much you can hold effectively, it does take into account that some things are too awkward to effectively carry despite being fairly light.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These containers increase your Carry by the noted amount.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The exceptions, sort of, to this are coin purses, which make coins negligible (otherwise they’re 10 = 1S), quivers which do the same thing but with arrows, and scabbards and sheaths allow you to wear weapons - shrinking them 1 size.</p><h3>GOING OVER CARRY</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can go over your Carry, of course, but each M item worth over your limit increases your Encumbrance by +1, which is fairly forgiving for S and smaller items but not for L and larger items.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Unless proven otherwise, the GM should assume the characters are carrying their max Carry if they pick up something new while out adventuring.</p><h1>Currency</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The denominations of coinage is fairly simple and is done in divisions of 10.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> 10 brass coins (bc) = 1 copper coin (cc)</p><p style="margin:0px;"> 10 cc = 1 silver coin (sc)</p><p style="margin:0px;"> 10 sc = 1 gold coin (gc)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> 10 gc = 1 platinum coin (pc)</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, 100 cc is equal to 1 gc.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The silver coin is the base of the economy and is what most day to day interactions use. If a denomination isn’t noted, it’s assumed to be sc.</p><h1>Buying At 1st Level</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> A character starts with one of the following kits. After doing so, he rolls the kit's Extra Cash dice to determine any extra starting money to buy additional gear. When buying new items, use the Source price. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The individual sizes are notes next to the item. Note that anything with * at the end denotes that the item is worn and so the size has been adjusted accordingly. You're also given the sellback price (in sc) in case you don't want the item. For weapons, you'll notice that you're giving a generic size of weapon you can select from - the sellback price is unaffected by which weapon you would have picked up. </p><table

You should note that should you purchase Medium or Heavy armor, this comes with a Gambeson that’s worn underneath for comfort. This is already factored into the other stats of the armor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Weight</strong> This is how heavy your armor is for encumbrance when your armor is carried on your person.

Lugging a huge piece of material on the end of your arm makes dodging a bit difficult. Additionally, you’re often moving a shield into harm’s way, meaning, overall, you get hit more while wielding one.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Parry</strong> Some shields are balanced better than others and that allows you to deflect blows more effectively. This number is the shield’s Parry Threshold. This is overrides by your weapon’s Parry. Parrying with a shield subjects it to the Shield Breakage rules.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Cover</strong> This dice is added to your Defense roll against ranged weapons.

The buckler also has the added benefit of being rather small with almost no weight, allowing it to be worn but not used while wielding two handed weapons. You receive no bonuses when doing this but it means that if you do switch over to a one handed weapon, you instantly get the buckler’s bonus.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Round</strong> This shield was meant for hitting your opponent, trying to throw them off guard. On a natural roll of 20 on Defense or an Unarmed Strike, you delay your opponent’s next attack by 5 seconds.</p><h5>The Weird</h5><h1>What Is Weird?</h1><p style="margin:0px;">Seems like a reasonable place to start. It is called a lot of things by different cultures: mana, magic, juju, but essentially, it’s the metaphysical power that allows people to reshape reality, which is why working with it is often called weirdshaping, or simply shaping, if you don’t want to sound pretentious.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Weird lies beneath the surface of all things, a hidden power that imbues life with those indescribable feelings. It is the reason you feel attracted to someone at first sight, are speechless when you see a beautiful view, or the reason why planets have healing properties. It is not that some things are inherently ‘magical’ or ‘non-magical’ - all things have weird that is waiting to be shaped.</p><h1>Anatomy Of A Spell</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When you shape the weird, it manifests in the Middle Realm as a spell, which is broken up into different parts or “Rudiments”, which are split into types. More details on the specifics is found under the Acquiring Rudiments section below but here’s a brief overview:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHAPE </strong>This is the shape that the spell shows up in. This can be a circle, cone, or wall, for example.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RANGE </strong>This depends on the Shape of the spell but generally it’s the reach of the spell: how long is the cone or how far can you launch a salvo shaped spell.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ORIGIN </strong>This is where the spell comes into being: this can start as the weird-adept and emanate out, it can imminent from his touch, or it can manifest yards away from him.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EFFECT </strong>This is where the spell usually gets its name and it’s what it actually does. A spell can cause Stress, remove friction, change appearances, and so on. Effects will also list the Interval, which will talk about next, and the base Range for that spell.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Effects are also special because you can add multiple Effects (or even the same effect multiple times, thus making it more powerful) to the same spell but increasing the Drain in the same amount. If it isn’t clear how an Effect would work if Stacked with itself, there’s a Stacking section for each Effect that should clear things up.</p><h3>SHAPING A SPELL</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Each of a spell’s Rudiments will have a Drain value, which added together, is how much that spell costs to cast. A spell must have at least 1 of each Rudiment type.</p><h3>FALLOUT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Bending reality and shaping primordial force is not an easy thing to do and nature doesn’t like it. When you first shape a spell, you take Stress equal to your Encumbrance. This is a one time cost so continuing to shape the same spell doesn't further Stress you out (as long as you don't suffer weirdburn, of course).</p><h1>Weird Traditions</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Ways of shaping the Weird are split up into different “Traditions”, which with their own bent on ways the Weird can manifest. These are:</p><h3>ANIMISM </h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on the manipulation of the body, forcing it to endure beyond its normal limits and making it into a weapon.</p><h3>CALLING </h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on the Realms beyond the Middle one we’re so fond of. It involves the summoning of demons, elementals, and spirits.</p><h3>CHARM </h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This focuses on the manifestation of the Weird in its raw and primal form. This allows the Weird to interact with our world in a more physical way.</p><h3>GLAMOUR</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on the manipulation of the senses, tricking the brain into seeing what the weird-adept wants you to see.</p><h3>INVESTITURE </h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This focuses on inanimate objects and either imbuing them with power or manifesting the latent potential that is already in them.</p><h3>OCCULTISM </h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on the hidden world and opening of the third mind: the divination of knowledge and the unseen.</p><h3>SORTILEGE </h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on fate, chance, and probability: more specifically, it focuses on messing with it so that things go in your favor.</p><h1>Acquiring Rudiments</h1><p style="margin:0px;">At 1st level and as dedicated by your Archetypes, you’ll have the opportunity to acquire new Rudiments, which you can then use to shape spells. You’ll do so by picking a Rudiment table and then rolling on it. If you roll a Rudiment you already have, you may select the Rudiment on either side of it. For Effects, you roll on the Effects By Tradition table and then go to the corresponding sub-table. You may spend a CrP to reroll as per the norm, even during level up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Players that seek out the knowledge to gain a specific Rudiment during play can forgo this roll and simply gain that Rudiment, however, they can’t learn more Rudiments than their Archetype and level dictates.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At first level, it is required that you have at least 1 Rudiment from each type (so, 1 Shape Rudiment, 1 Origin Rudiment, and so on) but once that’s satisfied they can go back.</p><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Shape Rudiments </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll (d8)</td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1 - 2</td><td>Circle</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>3</td><td>Chain</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>4</td><td>Cone</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>5</td><td>Salvo</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>6</td><td>Sphere</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>7</td><td>Ray</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>8</td><td>Wall</td></tr></table><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Range Rudiments </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll (d4)</td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Double</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>Full</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td>Half</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td>Personal</td></tr></table><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Origin Rudiments </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll (d4)</td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Aura</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>Touch</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td>Near</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td>Far</td></tr></table><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Effects Rudiments </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll (d8)</td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Animism</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>Calling</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td>Charm</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td>Glamour</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5</td><td>Investiture</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6</td><td>Occult</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>7</td><td>Sortilege</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>8</td><td>Reroll</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Roll on this the Effects by Traditions Table to determine which Effects Table to roll on.

It extends from the Origin with a Radius equal to the Base Range of the Effect. Anyone within the Circle is affected by the spell. If it deals damage or inflicts Stress, this occurs on the Interval or if a person enters/re-enters the shape. If not cast far enough away, this could also include the weird-adept.</p><h3>CHAIN</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 0</p><p style="margin:0px;">This is the most primal Shape a spell can come in. The weird-adept casts the spell and it chooses 1 viable, random target within the Range of the Spell. After half the spell’s Interval, it then leaps to the next. Anyone hit by the spell suffers its Effects for the entire time the spell is cast.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">People may be hit multiple times, which simply counts as the spell Stacking on them, but the weird-adept may try and redirect the spell, causing it to skip over a person, but they take Stress equal to the number of times they’ve done so.</p><h3>CONE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 3</p><p style="margin:0px;">The Cone starts with its tip at the Origin and then extends in a 45 degree arch from it up to the spell’s Range. Anyone within the Cone is affected by the spell. If it deals damage or inflicts Stress, this occurs on the Interval or if a person enters/re-enters the shape.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Cone can also be moved and shifted, rotating around its Origin, moving a facing every 3 seconds.</p><h3>SALVO</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 5</p><p style="margin:0px;">The Salvo is the spell chucked up to its Range from the spell’s Origin. It requires a ranged attack to hit (though ignoring Cover). On a miss, it follows the normal ranged miss rules. Anyone that is hit, suffers the full effects of the spell. If it deals damage or inflicts Stress, this occurs on the Interval.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Those within 10 ft of the Salvo’s touchdown location (even on a total miss) suffer the effects of the spell for half its Interval.</p><h3>SPHERE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 5</p><p style="margin:0px;">The spell takes on the shape of a 2 ft diameter sphere that flies around, coming into being at the spell’s Origin. While the weird-adept has complete control over the direction with only minimal effort (so it doesn’t affect what else he’s doing), it still has some limitations. The first is that it only goes 10 ft / second, no faster, no slower, and the weird-adept may only turn it 45 degrees every 3 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Anyone touched by the sphere suffers the Effects of the spell.</p><h3>RAY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 2</p><p style="margin:0px;">The ray is a thin line of magic that extends from the spell’s Origin up the 3 times the spell’s Range. It manifests in a single instant, requiring a roll to hit, but those that it hits, suffer the full Effect of the spell.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If no one was hit and the spell is still being cast, the weird-adept can manifest another ray and try again until he hits or he decasts the spell.</p><h3>WALL</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 2</p><p style="margin:0px;">The wall is a line that starts at the spell’s Origin and extends up to its Range, but also into the air and below the ground up to 50 ft.

From there, the weird-adept can order the demon to do their bidding.</p><p style="margin:0px;">There are different types and categories of demons, each with different abilities that can get a specific job. Some are brutish and stupid, while others are cunning and skillful. Some come linked with certain symbols, such as gateways or the birth of children, that give them powers related to them.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The basic spell conjures just a random demon type, which Circle value is 1, or the lowest rung of the aetherial world that exists between the other realms.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The summoner can also weigh the odds in his favor when it comes to what categories of demon he summons. He can modify the dice roll by his level in either direction. He may also use his SP in the same way though this does increase the Drain by a like amount.</p><p style="margin:0px;">A demon appears in a random location within the Shape of the spell and rolls a d3 initiative dice.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Demons, even relatively dumb ones, are intelligent creatures and will struggle to overcome their bindings. Anytime you change a demon’s command, the demon rolls a d20 + its Circle (and the Circle of any other demons controlled by the weird-adept) in a one round Conflict. If it wins, the weird-adept loses control and the demon goes rogue, first seeking out the weird-adept to try and kill them as quickly as possible. If it can’t do that, it will do as much damage as possible to what’s around it and then try to kill itself.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The weird-adept can try to cast Bind Demon again to try and regain control. If the Circle you could have summoned is greater than the rogue demon’s Circle, you regain control... for now.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Demons are forced to stay in the area they were summoned in, following it wherever it goes if the Shape can be moved. If it breaks its binding, it may, of course, run free.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Demons are wily creatures, always trying to find loopholes in their orders and while there are implicit bindings in the summon that prevent obvious loophole breaching, they’ll do the bare minimum of what’s asked of them. </p><p style="margin:0px;">This binding does make them more susceptible to suggestion as well and others may enter into a Conflict with the demon to get it to do or reveal things, on one condition: it can’t go against their summoner’s orders.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, a demon ordered to patrol a hall can be forced to reveal information about its master or how many people are in each room, but it can’t be forced by others to stop patrolling (or even not attack the players, should it be told to kill anyone in the hall).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STACK</strong> Increase the Circle of the demon by 1.</p><h3>BIND ELEMENTAL HEART</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRADITION</strong> Calling</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BASE DRAIN</strong> 3</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BASE RANGE</strong> 20 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INTERVAL</strong> 30 seconds</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EFFECT</strong> This spell either conjures an elemental heart from it’s realm or binds one that has gone rogue.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Once in this realm, the elemental heart robes itself in nearby sympathetic elements, giving a form with which it can then move. Without it’s dead kin around, the heart becomes inert and defenseless. So, while there are Order and Chaos Elementals, neither of those two things have a physical manifestation in the Middle Realm and so they simply lay there.</p><p style="margin:0px;">A conjured elemental with a Weird of d4!. The higher the Weird, the more powerful the elemental. Stats for elementals are found in the <a target="_blank" href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/">Bonfire Bestiary.</a></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Elementals are ‘liquid’ and can shift and change their form. Their Weird can be invested to increase their baseline stats and special abilities. How much this costs is determined by the type of heart summoned. Weird can assigned at the time of summoning but also rearranged after, though this takes 1 second per point shift</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A summoned elemental heart appears in a random location within the Shape of the spell, determined by d12 for direction (12 being where the weird-adept is facing and 6 being directly behind him) and d20 for distance, and rolls a d12 initiative dice. During this time, the elemental is getting its barings and forming itself proper.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Elementals are intelligent creatures and will struggle to overcome their bindings. Anytime you change an elemental’s command, the elemental rolls a d8! + its Weird (and the Weird of any other elementals controlled by the weird-adept) in a one round Conflict. If it wins, the weird-adept loses control and the elemental goes rogue, first seeking out the weird-adept to try and kill them as quickly as possible</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The weird-adept can try to cast Bind Elemental Heart again to try and regain control. If the Weird you could have summoned is greater than the rogue elemental’s Weird, you regain control... for now.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If this spell is cast in any other Shape than Circle, the elemental is forced into that shape and unless the Shape can be moved, the elemental is rooted to the spot, only able to attack people who get within their Measure of that spot.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Shapes that require a roll to hit (Salvo and Ray) and do count that as the Elemental attack and thus include the Elementals damage or special attack.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STACK</strong> Increase the summoned Weird of the Elemental by d4!.</p><h3>BIND TO THE AVERAGE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRADITION</strong> Sortilege</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BASE DRAIN</strong> 2</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BASE RANGE</strong> 50 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INTERVAL</strong> 30 seconds</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EFFECT</strong> Any roll within the Shape of the spell moves 1 point towards the average.

The bound spirit starts at its full Vitality but is unable to heal wounds by natural, magic, or divine means. Additionally, they’re unable to heal Stress.

The object in question only moves by hops and at points of articulation, so it doesn’t gain the ability to bend unnaturally.</p><p style="margin:0px;">In this way, a teapot or candlestick may hop about in a primitive form of locomotion, while a lock may only move its tumblers and an actual puppet may move as a person does, though this control is crude.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STACK</strong> Increase the size of the object by 1 Small.</p><h3>MIMIC</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRADITION</strong> Glamour</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BASE DRAIN</strong> 1</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BASE RANGE</strong> 30 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INTERVAL</strong> 15 Seconds</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EFFECT</strong> This allows the weird-adept to create a phantom noise anywhere within the Shape of the spell.

The mark can be made invisible except under a certain condition noted at the time of shaping, but is otherwise visible.</p><p style="margin:0px;">To find this object or person again, all the weird-adept must do to know the location of the target is close her eyes and concentrate for a minute. She then knows in what direction and how far away it is.</p><p style="margin:0px;">On top of this, any attempt to magically conceal the object or person from the weird-adept doesn’t work.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STACK</strong> This can affect an object 1 size larger.

The weird-adept can also affect items as long as they’re not directly touching a person. Blades glance off armor and shields, giving them an additional point of Parry and projectiles are less affected by wind resistance (as long as they’re fired from within the spell’s Shape), giving them a +1 damage.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STACK</strong> Increase Parry and/or Damage by 1.</p><h3>OUTCRY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRADITION</strong> Animism</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BASE DRAIN</strong> 1</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BASE RANGE</strong> 30 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INTERVAL</strong> 15 Seconds</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EFFECT</strong> This forces everyone within the Shape of the spell to suddenly cry out and speak only at full volume and basically make as much noise as possible.

If the effect is simply applied without a Con check, its penalties are lowered by -2. If it is a pleasant scent, swap those bonuses for penalties as people naturally breathe in deeper.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Either way, Perception Checks to detect anything airborne is also harder, gaining a +15 and if a character is normally allowed a chance to defend against it (such as quickly covering their nose or refusing to breathe in from that point forward) that is forfeit.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STACK</strong> Either increase the bonus to Checks and automatic affects by +/-5 and +/-2 respectively or make the Perception Checks harder by +5.</p><h3>PHANTOMBINDING</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRADITION</strong> Calling</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BASE DRAIN</strong> 2</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BASE RANGE</strong> 15 ft</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INTERVAL</strong> 6 Hour</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EFFECT</strong> While the spell is cast, all those in the Shape of the spell have an ancestral spirit following them around.

These are codified into Covenants, or promises they make with their servants in exchange for a portion of the Divine’s power.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Cults of that Divine typically pick one, maybe two Covenants, of their chosen Divine to focus on.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This means that priests of different cults may not get along with each other and there can even be intra-faith wars to purge heretics (those that focus on different Covenant from them).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The main bonus of Covenants is that they make Miracles within them easier to invoke. The specifics are elaborated on in the Invoking Miracles section below.</p><h3>COSMIC LINKS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Higher Planes are those that exist above the crude and primitive world and so, naturally, the Divines are linked to the events and behaviors of the celestial bodies that make their homes in the heavens.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A Cosmic Link is the specific celestial body that the Divine is associated with and it usually gives an insight to the personality of the god. The Cosmic Link doesn’t necessarily mean your Patron is primarily the Divine of that Cosmic thing. So, a Divine associated with the moon might not be primarily a moon god, in the same way that while Venus was associated with the Morning Star, she was primarily viewed as a love goddess by the Romans. Still, your holy symbols may incorporate the moon motif commonly to represent her.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For clarification’s sake: when something says “decrease” in this section’s explanations, you go down the chart by that many steps. If it says “increase” go up, so increase will always be a bonus, and decrease will always be bad.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COMET </strong>This is associated with fervent but fleeting powers. Whenever you invoke a Miracle, you gain two Honor Dice with a +3 but lose an additional Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EVENING STAR </strong>The evening star is a source of strength and beauty: it's the first star to rise in the evening. When you invoke a Miracle, if you roll below the average, you gain the average instead. So, if you roll d8 and get a 3 or less, you get 4 instead.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MOON </strong>The moon is a steady force, its effects are subtle but constant. When you invoke a Miracle, if you roll two Honor Dice, keeping the highest.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MORNING STAR </strong>The morning star is the last star in the heavens before day and is a lone watcher. When you invoke a Miracle and roll the minimum amount, you don’t lose any Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SUN </strong>The sun is the lord of heaven, strong and unbending, its power unquestioned. When you invoke a Miracle and roll the max amount, you don’t lose any Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CYCLICAL </strong>Often hailing from older, more primitive times, the Cyclical deity represents earthly inevitabilities in a dichotomy, sometimes with themselves and sometimes with an opposing deity. This can be Spring and Summer, life and death, creation and destruction. They may be weak now, but they will wax unstoppable. When you invoke a Miracle, and roll under its average, your next Miracle gains a +1. This is cumulative.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you roll above its average, this bonus is then removed and you get a -1 to your next Miracle. Again, this is cumulative and resets when you roll below.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if you have a d6! Honor Dice, and you roll a 2, the next Miracle you invoke gets a +1. That next Miracle you roll, you get a 3 for a total of 4 (because of the +1), giving you a +2 the next roll. On that roll, you roll a 5 for a total of 7 ( 5 + 2 ). The next Miracle you then invoke gets a -1.</p><h1>Favor Of The Divines</h1><h3>WHAT IS FAVOR?</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Favor is a measure of your standing with a given god. It’s not an absolute measure, however, but more a measure of the chance that a Divine will answer your prayer. How far your Favor goes ranges widely based on how devoted you are to a god and how Honor you are.</p><h3>LEVELS OF DEVOTION</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There are 3 levels of commitment to a Covenant, that determine how often you get Favor and how much Favor you can have:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>UNANOINTED </strong>are the lowest level: those outside the cult and its mysteries. They gain no benefits of any kind.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ANOINTED </strong>are those that are the lay members of the faith. They gain small bonuses to their max Favor for the deity they’re devoted to. You can only be anointed to one Covenant at a time.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you have a positive Devotion to a deity, one of their cults, or one of their Covenants, you can choose to begin the game as an anointed to that deity. Otherwise, you can become Anointed during gameplay once you have that Devotion.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You can only be anointed to one deity at a time.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SERVANTS </strong>are the highest rung of the commitment ladder and serve as the officers of the cult of the god. They’re priests, abbots, hierophants, pontiffs, nazarites, hermits, etc.. These are men and women that have taken vows to devote their life to the cult. In game terms, this means that these are those who have a Servant Archetype as either their Primary or Secondary Archetype.</p><h3>ACQUIRING FAVOR</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Servants turn their eyes from the earth below to higher worlds, both literally and metaphorically. In this way, they’re the keeper of the times and seasons, as well as the calendar to note the occurrence of Holy Days.</p><p style="margin:0px;">As such, players who play Servants will need to keep track of the passage of time. Doing so gives them special bonuses according to the schedule laid out below. You’ll note that it follows the Gregorian Calendar layout with holy days happening according to the Judeo-Christian traditions. The assumption that the characters will be following an in-game calendar with random Holy Days specific to their cult but we’re “translating” into the Gregorian calendar, in the same way that we assume the characters are actually speaking in their native fantasy tongues and not in English. Doing this makes it easier for players to keep track because the calendar is a familiar shape. They won’t have to track out a whole year and remember that Beltane is on the 5th of Seed’s Row. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Rules for using your own calendar and keeping all Servants relatively balanced against each other is going to be the Advanced Rules.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Favor is unique to the Divine you’re petitioning. Gaining Favor with another Divine, means that you lose an equal amount of Favor with all others because gods are bad at sharing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DAILY SACRIFICES (EVERY DAY) </strong>These are small, daily sacrifices. These tend to cost about 1 or 2 sc, 5 to 6 points of Stress, or 1 or 2 Vitality, depending on your Divine's preferences. They can be the sacrifice of a small, sacred animal, the burning of a portion of your meal, or the lighting of incense during morning prayers. They net 1 Favor for Servants of that Divine.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SABBATIC HOLY DAY (EVERY 7 DAYS) </strong>This is a day of rest and contemplation, where the faithful are instructed to put aside the things of the world and focus on the Divine with activities related to their Covenant. There is an emphasis on ritual over practicality to emphasize this divide, so while a Divine of Battle encourages his followers to fight every day, on his sabbath he only wants them to focus on ritualistic combat and controlled bloodshed, as opposed to actual combat. Again, this is to remind his followers of the holiness of the action and by forcing his followers to stop and think about their actions, he forces them to contemplate the deeper realities of combat. The sabbath takes up 1 to 3 hours and the rest of the day can be spent at the faithful wants.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Servants who observe the sabbath of their Divine gain all Favor back, while anointed worshippers gain their Min Favor from Charisma if they roll a 4 or better on their highest Devotion die related to that Divine. Unanointed worshippers gain nothing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LUNAR HOLY DAY (4 SABBATIC HOLY DAYS) </strong>Where normal Sabbaths are days of rest, Lunar Holy Days are about sacrifices and consecration, which are thematically appropriate to the cult’s Covenant. Those observing the holy day need to stop and spend the whole day or they gain no benefit.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Servants gain all Favor back plus extra Favor equal to their Min Favor. This extra Favor is reset on the next Lunar Holy Day (which means you can’t stockpile it). The Anointed gain all Favor back, while the unanointed who celebrate gain 1 Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SOLAR HOLY DAY (EVERY 3 LUNAR HOLY DAYS) </strong>These holy days celebrate the turning of the seasons and where the other festivals can be severe, with fasting and reading and nerd stuff like that, Solar Holy Days are about feasting and letting loose a bit. The Divines demand their faithful to party all day.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Servants gain all Favor back plus extra Favor equal to a roll of their Devotion die. This extra Favor is reset on the next Solar Holy Day (which means you can’t stockpile it). The anointed faithful gain their full Favor back and the unanointed gain their Min Favor from Charisma if they roll a 4 or better on their highest Devotion die related to that Divine.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ANNUAL HOLY DAY (EVERY 4 SOLAR HOLY DAYS) </strong>The Annual Holy Day either celebrates the new year or an important event in the cult, such as the birth of their messiah or the founding of their faith. It is a 2 day affair and is often occupied by feasting, gift giving, public rituals, and other such nonsense.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Servants and Anointed followers gain all Favor back with Servants also gaining extra Favor equal to the max of their Devotion die and the Anointed followers gaining extra Favor equal to a roll of their Devotion die. For Servants, this extra Favor is reset on the next Annual Holy Day (which means you can’t stockpile it). The unanointed gain 1 Favor</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TAKING AN OATH (SPECIAL) </strong>Not a sacrifice or holy day parse, Taking an Oath is essentially getting Favor on loan from the Divines for the promise that, if you get out the bad situation you're in, you'll make a huge sacrifice to them soon after. By Taking an Oath, you gain a die worth of Favor for every 20% of treasure you gain from the adventure you promise to the Divine, should you survive.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This die is equal to the highest Devotion die related to the Divine you're petitioning if you're Anointed to them. The Unanointed must also promise to become Anointed in addition to the cash and goods, in which case they gain a d8! worth of Favor. This Favor can put you over your max but must be spent on a Miracle immediately. </p><p style="margin:0px;">The Divines are extremely litigious. If you don't fulfill your oath in 1 month + 1 for every Honor Category higher than Average Honor you're in, they will seek vengeance. You may no longer gain any Favor with any Divine that shares a pantheon with the one you're in and what you do have will decay, causing you to lose 1 Favor per day. Priests of the Divine will also condemn you as an oath breaker, a very serious accusation, causing you to drop 1 Honor Category per month and preventing you from increasing your Honor. Should you fall into Dishonor, you gain the Excommunicated Flaw.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CRUSADES & PILGRIMAGES (SPECIAL) </strong>There are holy places to visit and holy things to be done. Crusades and Pilgrimages are special rewards the GM can give out for furthering the Divine’s will. This can either be through an actual holy war or by waging a spiritual war of conversion. These don’t even need to be things done on purpose and can be part of the campaign. </p><p style="margin:0px;">The GM should award a roll of the crusader or pilgrim's Devotion dice, allowing it to go over the Max Favor allowed, and awarding them Honor for furthering their deity’s influence in the Middle Realm. Additionally, if it was an amazing feat of faith, the GM may also increase the character’s Devotion dice size. </p><p style="margin:0px;">The unanointed gain no benefit from crusades and pilgrimages.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CONDEMNATION & ABSOLUTION (SPECIAL) </strong>Servants and Anointed followers are expected to hold to the Divine’s tenets more closely and so can come under condemnation for disobeying their deity. GMs may subtract Favor from Servants and Anointed followers for sins against their religion or prevent them from gaining Favor for prolonged transgressions. Servants and Anointed followers with the Religion Advanced Skill in their Covenant receive a warning before they act (having studied their religion to some extent).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Those that have transgressed must seek absolution before they gain the benefit of holy days and sacrifices again. What this means varies based on the magnitude of the sin.</p><h3>MAXIMUM FAVOR</h3><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Maximum Favor </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Honor Cate</td><td>Max Favor</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Dishonorable</td><td>Cannot Invoke</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Low Honor</td><td>0</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Average Honor</td><td>1</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>High Honor</td><td>2</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Great Honor</td><td>3</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Anointed</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Servant</td><td>Varies</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;">A person can only have so much Favor, with the Divines giving a little extra leeway for those of strong character. The Max Favor a person can have is limited to their Honor Category.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Anointed members increase this threshold by 1 while Servants increase their Max Favor by their level, but both cannot gain any Favor while in the Dishonorable Category, regardless of level.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Should a person drop an Honor Category, if their Favor is above their new max, it automatically drops.</p><h1>Invoking Miracles</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Now that you’ve got a nice stash of Favor, you probably want to spend it. That’s pretty simple: pray out loud for the Miracle in question. Silent prayers don’t work because no Divine is going to answer a prayer they’re not going to get credit for.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For every Favor you spend, you get another use of your Honor Dice but comes with a few differences: the first, and most major, is that you can spend it on ANYTHING - you want to run faster or jump higher? You want to heal your wounds? You want to attack slightly faster? You can with Favor, however, the effects are only temporary, of course.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The second is that you can spend to change the world around you. Every Favor you spend can change a 5 ft square area with the following restriction: it can’t directly contradict things that have already been said.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Miracles are also bound by Covenant: you can’t pray for something your Divine doesn’t have power over, so a Divine of the city can’t really help you in the mountains, for example.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But this is where being in a pantheon does help out: you can pray to another Divine in your pantheon for their blessing instead, but it requires twice as much Favor and you don’t gain the benefit of your Cosmic Link.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The other restriction is that the Miracles need to be subtle: no angels coming down from the skies to keep you from falling to your death but perhaps there’s water or a passing hay cart that catches you just in time to soften your landing. There needs to be room for doubt.</p><h5>Character Progression</h5><p style="margin:0px;"> A person who sets off on an adventure doesn’t return the same person as they were when they left. Trials and hardships not only hone their skill, but also who they are and what they stand for. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> In Bonfire, this change is measured by Experience (Ex), which is counted at the end of every session.</p><h1>Gaining Experience</h1><table style="width:160px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Experience to Level </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Experience Needed</td><td>Total Level</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>50</td><td>2</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>170</td><td>3</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>350</td><td>4</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>590</td><td>5</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>890</td><td>6</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1250</td><td>7</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>1670</td><td>8</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>2150</td><td>9</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2690</td><td>10</td></tr></table><table style="width:160px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">  </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Experience Needed</td><td>Total Level</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3290</td><td>11</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>3950</td><td>12</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>4670</td><td>13</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>5450</td><td>14</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>6290</td><td>15</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>7190</td><td>16</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>8150</td><td>17</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>9170</td><td>18</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>10250</td><td>19</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>11390</td><td>20</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"> The only way to gain Experience is to move towards your Goals or help others move towards theirs.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> At the end of each session, if you've moved towards a Goal, whether your own or another player's, whether your character knew about it or not, you gain 25 Ex. If you moved towards additional Goals, you get a extra 10 Ex for each one you helped with. However, they only get the bonus Ex for helping another person if their goals aren't identical to yours.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, let's say that you moved towards one of your Goals and helped another person with theirs. You would get 35 Ex (25 + 10). Or let's say that there wasn't enough time to do anything on your Goal, but you managed to help two other players; you'd still get 35 Ex at the end of the session (25 for the first, 10 for the second). Or, or, if you were a real wunderkind, and moved towards your Goal AND helped the two other players, you'd get 45 Ex (25 + 10 + 10). </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There is a bonus of another 25 Ex for each member if everyone in the party has moved towards their Goals that session.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> On top of this, if a party member actually completes one of their Goals, they (and anyone else who helps them) gains an additional 25% of their current Ex as well at 5 Honor (though this only applies to the person who completed it).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The GM may award additional Ex for completing plot important points in the story.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You don’t receive Ex for random things, such as winning a Social Conflict, Combats, or Skill Challenges. Those are more about gaining Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You gain Ex for challenging who your character is. If they gain Ex from a Combat it is not from just defeating a random foe or just being in Combat. It could be from your character facing their fears or rival, killing a person for the first time, or learning to be a leader in a stressful situation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Those things are a means to an end, not an end in and of themselves. </p><h1>Leveling Up</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Once a character has received enough Ex to level, they must take a week to think and meditate on what they’ve learned.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> During this week, they reflect on their journey and how they’ve changed. Each day, they complete one of the steps of leveling up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This self-reflection takes a large amount of the day. If the character is interrupted by any strenuous activity, they’ve lost the day and must pick up their reflection when they can from the same point.</p><h3>DAY 1: RECEIVE CrP</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> At the start of his reflection, a character receives a number of CrP equal to his LvL CrP from his Intellect. This behaves exactly like CrP from Character Creation and can be used to buy things at any stage or reroll everything but Vitality.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can spend these are different points over the level up process but you can also save them up to purchase more expensive things if you don’t currently have enough CrP for what you want.</p><h3>DAY 2: INCREASE STAT SCORES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Today you may spend CrP to improve any of your Scores as per Step 6 of <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/1"]' [queryParams]="{search: '1h6'}">Chapter 1: Character Creation.</a> </p><p style="margin:0px;"> At 3rd level and every 5 levels after that (8, 13, 18, etc.), you may increase 1 of your Stats by 1</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And at 5th level and every 5 levels after that (10, 15, 20, etc.), you increase a random Stat by 1. This is rolled on a d6, with 1 being Strength and 6 being Charisma. You may influence with your Honor or spend 15 CrP for a reroll. </p><h3>DAY 3: ASSESS PERSONALITY </h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FLAWS</strong> A character can grow, overcoming things that used to hold her down. A character can buy off a mental or behavioral Flaw for its CrP bonus (regardless of how much you got for it). If you do so, you gain a 2d6 Trait “Overcame X” with X being the Flaw. Background Flaws that have resolved through play can also give you this Trait according to the GM's discretion.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRAITS</strong> As a character grows, things that used to be important to them no longer are and things they never used to identify with become a part of them.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character can switch around their Traits, switching a Strong one for a Medium one, or a Medium one for a Weak one. This swaps the number of dice - not the size of those dice. So, swapping a 1d8 trait for 3d10 trait makes one 3d8 and the other 1d10.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> They may also swap out a Weak one for an entirely new one.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> After 3rd level, they may only do this swap once per level, however. Before then, you may swap your Traits around freely: after all, you may still be getting on your feet in terms of the type of character that would best fit in the group and campaign. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PASSIONS</strong> Passions die out and are relit. A character may increase the size of a Passion by decreasing the size of another.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This can drop the Passion to below 1, allowing the character to develop a new one.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> After 3rd level, you may only do this trade once per level. Before that, you may swap around your Passions freely.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GOALS</strong> During this time, the character carefully turns over their aims in life and can ask themselves if this is really the path they want to travel down.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Goals may be switched out, dropped or added freely at this stage but can't total more than 3.</p><h3>DAY 4: INCREASE ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Before you begin this day, it's time to decide whether or not you want to purchase your Archetype Specializations, if you haven't already. This follows the normal rules set forth in <a [routerLink]='["/chapter/4"]' [queryParams]="{search: 'IfyoupurchasLOzKLPalkr'}">Chapter 4: Archetypes</a>. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Once you do that, check your selected Archetypes (or new Specialist Archetype(s)) to see if they have any of their Abilities that either grow stronger (i.e. the Thug’s Precision Strike), gain additional free Skills (i.e. any of the Expert Archetype’s Skill Focuses), or gain something else for free (i.e. the Weird-Adept Archetypes gaining new Rudiments).</p><h3>DAY 5: TRAIN AND RETRAIN SKILLS & TRAININGS </h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Now, it’s time to home in on what you’ve learned and any new skills you’ve acquired or hidden talents you’ve discovered during your travels.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At this stage you may spend your CrP to purchase and improve your Skills and Trainings.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character may also replace old knowledge with new. He may refund one of his Trainings and Skill purchases, gaining the CrP he spend on them back to spend on something else.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After 3rd level, he may only do this once per level up for each. Before that point, he may do this freely. He can never refund free Trainings or Skills earned from his Archetypes.</p><h3>DAY 6: INCREASE VITALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Finally, it’s time to reflect on the fact that your travels have made you just a little bit tougher, a little bit better at facing what life throws at you.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> At every even level, the character gets a free reroll of their Vitality Die from their last level, taking the higher of the two rolls, however, if both rolls are under their Minimum Vitality from their Constitution, they receive that value at least.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At every odd level, they gain a free roll that’s added to their total Vitality. This is not affected by their Con’s Min Vitality and is just a straight roll. You’ll need to record it on your character sheet.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If your Primary has a “choose the higher of 2” for their Vitality die, your Vitality Dice drops to one of those dice. So, “the higher of 2d6” becomes a single d6 for subsequent levels.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Remember to recalculate your Wound Categories</p><h3>DAY 7: ADJUST HONOR & REPUTATION</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Now the other players will have a chance to adjust your <strong class='orangeHeader'>HONOR</strong> by silently judging the character, rating him 1 to 10 in 3 categories: Flaws, Teamwork, Respect.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FLAWS</strong> How well has this player played their Flaws? Do they only seem to be brought up when it’s convenient but then forgotten they need to get away with something?</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Does she use her Flaws to further the story and character development or does she use them to annoy others? </p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character that leans more to the former, rather than the latter, deserves a higher score.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TEAMWORK</strong> Does this player work well with others? Do they pull their load and put themselves on the line or do they pick fights that derail the session? Are they of top on things and help set up or are they late and spend all their time on the phone?</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Again, a character that leans more to the former, rather than the latter, deserves a higher score.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RESPECT</strong> How do you think this character is viewed by those he interacts with, by both the party’s character and NPCs? Has he kept his word (or at least, not gotten caught) or does he have a habit of backstabbing others?</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The GM should then take the scores and average them across each category and then subtract 5 from each of them. Those three modified averages are then totaled: this is how much Honor they gain or lose.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The individual scores and who gave them should be kept a secret, though the player can know how much they scored in each category to help them improve.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The GM will also adjust your <strong class='orangeHeader'>REPUTATION</strong> and complete your Reputation sentences as she deems appropriate. She gets to add 1 point at this point but she can also move as many existing points around as she wants. She may also change the ending to any Reputation sentences she wants.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">She may also ‘free’ them up to distribute later: so if your character moves far away where people haven’t heard of them, you could lose your Reputation, which might be good or bad.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note to GMs: while you can complete the sentences at any time, giving the player a heads up as to where their Reputation is headed, it isn’t advised that you start putting points into the other two Reputations until the character reaches 5th level.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you’ve reached 10th level, your GM should also roll to see if you’ve attracted a follower.</p><h5>Miscellaneous Rules</h5><h1>Stat Score Damage</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Stat Score damage occurs in several places and it’s fairly straightforward. Then why have this section, you ask? As a quick aside to keep the game moving.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The sudden change in ability is incredibly unnerving, meaning that until the person can stop, take a breath and re-adjust to their new reality (meaning the player can adjust the stats on his character sheet without breaking off Combat, a Conflict, a Challenge or any narrative tension the GM has built up), he gets a penalty of 1 for each point lost to anything that Stat Score influences. So, a -3 to Dexterity would net a temporary -3 to Attack, and Defense, +3 to Initiative, all while reducing the Social Die by 3 sizes, if applicable.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If the amount drained is more than the score, the person becomes appropriately incapacitated, but not dead, until the Stat Score damage is healed.</p><h1>Falling Damage</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When your character falls, they take damage based on how far that surpasses their DR from armor, however, they can do somethings to help their decent.</p><table style="width:175px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Falling Damage </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Distance (ft)</td><td>Damage</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>&#60;5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>10</td><td>1d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>20</td><td>2d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>40</td><td>3d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>60</td><td>4d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>70</td><td>5d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>75</td><td>6d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>80</td><td>7d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>82</td><td>8d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>85</td><td>9d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>87</td><td>10d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>90</td><td>11d12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>+1 Ft</td><td> +1d12!</td></tr></table><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Falling Modifiers </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Distance</td><td>Action</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-5 Ft</td><td>Expecting The Fall</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>- Height</td><td>Lowering Yourself First</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-5 Ft</td><td>Soft Landing</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-15 Ft</td><td>Water Landing</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>See Skill</td><td>Acrobatics Check</td></tr></table><h1>Illumination</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> For sake of simplicity, there’s five categorizations of how much light there is in an area:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BLINDING</strong> This is like staring into the sun. It's very painful and not very pleasant.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Assuming that you cover your eyes, you'll be acting as if you're blind. Even then, a moment's exposure even temporarily results in a d10! second delay as you try to recover. If you continue to expose yourself to this level of illumination, you'll be unable to act at all and will do blind in a number of seconds equal to your Con.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BRIGHT</strong> This is the leve of light of starting into a fire or just having your eyes near it. It sucks but it probably won't do permanent damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This doesn't really affect your aim or anything like that but it does make it difficult to focus on things, delaying any action by 1d4! seconds as you try and squint and see what you're doing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> It also lowers any Skill Checks that require sight by 2.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NORMAL</strong> This is normal daylight and occurs no operating penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DIM-LIGHTING</strong> This the equivalent of a dark room or nighttime. There’s some visibility; the character can make out shapes and shadows but no fine details.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> In melee combat, those in dim-lighting defend and attack with a 1d12! and using ranged weapons is even more of challenge. However, if you insist, you’ll be attacking with a 1d6!.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Any Skill Challenges that require sight have their difficulties increased by 2.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, Sprinting is impossible without acquiring a Stress per second moved.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DARK</strong> This is pitch black with the character not even being able to see their hands in front of their faces. This is a dungeon after the torch goes out.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Combat becomes difficult as anyone in darkness defends and attacks with a 1d6! And ranged combat is right out, but, if you insist, you’ll be attacking with a 1d4.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Any Skill Challenges that require sight have their Rank halved.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And moving above Strolling speed is extremely nerve racking, netting a Stress per Speed Category per second. So, moving at a Run for 3 seconds gives you 9 Stress (3 for the Run for 3 seconds).</p><h1> src="../../../assets/images/lights.png" alt="the different areas of light"</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are currently three sources of light. How they shed their light is noted on the left:</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The white is considered Normal, the light grey is Dimly Lit and the beyond that is Dark, assuming no other light sources are provided.</p><h1>Long-term Exhaustion</h1><table style="width:250px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="4" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Long-Term Exhaustion </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Need</td><td>Deprivation</td><td>Maintenance</td><td>Indulgence</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Food</td><td>1 lb</td><td>3 lb</td><td>5 lb</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Water</td><td>1/4 gallon</td><td>1/2 gallon</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Sleep</td><td>4 hours</td><td>6 hours</td><td>8 hours</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your character isn’t immortal, or at least, they didn’t start out that way, and so still needs to fulfil their basic needs of food, drink, and sleep. Without those basic requirements, he may find himself a bit more lethargic or, worse case scenario, dead.</p><p style="margin:0px;">There are three things your character needs to take care of, as mentioned above: food, water, and sleep, and three levels at which they either gain penalties or bonuses: Deprivation, Maintenance, and Indulgence. These bonuses and penalties stack.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DEPRIVATION</strong> is when your character starts to die of starvation, dehydration, and/or sleep deprivation. You take 1 point of damage per day for each time you’re below this threshold. This damage is on 1 Wound doesn’t heal until you bring that thing above Maintenance again. Going with limited sleep also inflicts 5 Stress. A Mental Break because of this causes the person to collapse and enter a deep sleep or go insane if they're unable to. </p><p style="margin:0px;">Doing a strenuous activity (Combat, Conflicts, or Skill Challenges, for example) you gives you an additional 2 Stress for each thing you're deprived off.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MAINTENANCE</strong> is when your character is getting enough to survive and that’s it. Being below this threshold but above Deprivation offers no bonuses or penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INDULGENCE</strong> is eating and sleeping more than you need to but not overeating or over sleeping. Being below this threshold but above Maintenance means that you gain an additional Relaxation that day. This stacks as well, though no additional bonuses for over-indulging.</p><h1>Sizing & Size Charts</h1><table style="width:270px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="3" style="background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Size Chart </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Size</td><td>Creature Size Equivalent</td><td>Item Size Equivalent</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Fine (F)</td><td>An Insect</td><td>A Jewel</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Diminutive (D)</td><td>A Bird</td><td>A Ring</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Tiny (T)</td><td>An Adult Cat</td><td>An Amulet</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Small (S)</td><td>A Large Dog</td><td>A Dagger</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Medium (M)</td><td>A Human</td><td>A Gallon Barrel</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Large (L)</td><td>A Horse</td><td>100 ft of Coiled Rope</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Huge (H)</td><td>A Car</td><td>A 50 Gallon Barrel (or Small Creature)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Giant (G)</td><td>A Bus</td><td>A Human</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Enormous (E)</td><td>A House</td><td>A 100 Gallon Barrel (or Large Creature)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Colossal (C)</td><td>A City Block</td><td>A Catapult</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;">RPGs give things somewhat arbitrary sizes because things affect you differently when you're different sizes. Here’s a handy chart to allow you to ballpark the Size Category something would be in if it ever comes up. These are given in real life, non-fantasy terms to be more helpful.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Most of the time this refers to area, but you can also determine size by weight, if it's applicable. A Ghost could be considered both Medium or Tiny by the metric - go with whatever applies best in that situation.</p>    </div><script src="js/script.js"></script></body></html>
