|hLearning Non-Standard Abilities|lPlayers who go out of their way to roleplay their character learning a new ability can get that ability irrespective of leveling, Archetype combination, and/or CrP spending, but only if they’ve taken some penalty for doing so (suffered for it) and only at the discretion of the GM.|pExample: the fighter is realizing that he’s finding his faith as the adventure progresses. He’s actively doing things to gain Favor but beyond that, while the rest of the characters are relaxing and healing in town, he’s off at the local temple, learning about his patron Divine.|pBecause of this, while the other players get Relaxation, he’s forfeiting that so the next couple of adventures see him with a higher average Stress (and thus closer to having a Mental Break) than the rest of the party.|pAdditionally, he sought out priests of his cult and paid them to teach him, thus sacrificing his own coin on their lessons rather than spending it on repairs, fine foods, or new gear.|lAfter a few sessions and adventures, he’s more than earned the Favored of the Divines ability that’s usually reserved for the Priest Archetype.|lThe rule of thumb is that a player must have gotten in at least 2d4!+2 situations where penalties they accrued in pursuit of their new ability have come into play. So, the fighter needs to go out on 5 adventures with his higher Stress for him to gain that ability.|pYou can adjust this as a GM: suppose the fighter got into a combat where his weapon broke due to him not repairing it and he nearly died because of it. In that case, you can count that as more than one.|lThe primary purpose of this is to dissuade players who are just trying to game the system and dipping here and there for specific abilities.|bRewards Beyond Wondrous Items |pNon-standard abilities can also be used as a reward in lieu of Wondrous Items. So, if you would give out a Relic or Occult Item, give out an ability instead, either through a divine boon or because of some talent a character has discovered they have.|bLeveling Abilities |pYou can also give out leveling abilities but, once gained, the character will need to continue to sacrifice and train to increase them: they don’t level up automatically as they don’t come naturally to them, although this can be for a lesser cost.|pIf you don’t want to keep track of that (and I don’t blame you), you can have these abilities increase at half the rate as they normally would but still increase automatically at level up.|bMade Up Abilities |pMaybe you can’t find an Archetype ability that matches what your player is going for. A common example that I’m sure will come up for you is ambidexterity.|pIn this case, use the same rules but give them that ability.|pSo if a character is constantly using his off-hand in combat, giving him a heavy penalty, after 2d4!+2 combats, he’s gotten the hang of it and gains ambidexterity.|bCrP Discounts for Skills & Trainings |lBeyond abilities, you can also use this to reward players by either discounting Skills and Trainings or just giving them to them. So, a character who uses a weapon they don't have Basic Training for, can get that Basic Training at a discount or for free at the next level up (or even during play).|lAgain, this is used to reward players who roleplay their character well and not for min-maxers to abuse so feel free to adjust these guidelines as you go for each individual player.|
