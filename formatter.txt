|5Anatomy of the Divine|2Covenants|lDivines have spheres of power that represent their aspects. These are codified into Covenants, or promises they make with their servants in exchange for a portion of the Divine’s power.|lCults of that Divine typically pick one, maybe two Covenants, of their chosen Divine to focus on.|lFor instance, Wülder, a Gothic god, watches over Raiding, Industry and Trade. There could be 3 different priests to Wülder, one focusing on his role as the Bridge Between Men, one seeing him as primarily a watcher over people going on cattle raids, and one worshiping him as the greater crafter and source of inspiration.|pWhile they all worship the same Divine, the Miracles they can invoke in his name are different.|lThis means that priests of different cults may not get along with each other and there can even be intra-faith wars to purge heretics (those that focus on different Covenant from them).|lThe main bonus of Covenants is that they make Miracles within them easier to invoke. The specifics are elaborated on in the Invoking Miracles section below.|2Cosmic Links|lThe Higher Planes are those that exist above the crude and primitive world and so, naturally, the Divines are linked to the events and behaviors of the celestial bodies that make their homes in the heavens.|pA Cosmic Link is the specific celestial body that the Divine is associated with, and it usually gives an insight to the personality of the god. The Cosmic Link doesn’t necessarily mean your Patron is primarily the Divine of that Cosmic thing. So, a Divine associated with the moon might not be primarily a moon god, in the same way that while Venus was associated with the Morning Star, she was primarily viewed as a love goddess by the Romans. Still, your holy symbols may incorporate the moon motif commonly to represent her.|lFor clarification’s sake: when something says “decrease” in this section’s explanations, you go down the chart by that many steps. If it says “increase” go up, so increase will always be a bonus, and decrease will always be bad.|3Comet |lThis is associated with fervent but fleeting powers. Whenever you invoke a Miracle, you gain two Honor Dice with a +3 but lose an additional Favor.|3Evening Star|lThe evening star is a source of strength and beauty: it's the first star to rise in the evening. When you invoke a Miracle, if you roll below the average, you gain the average instead. So, if you roll d8 and get a 3 or less, you get 4 instead.|3Moon|lThe moon is a steady force, its effects are subtle but constant. When you invoke a Miracle, if you roll two Honor Dice, keeping the highest.|3Morning Star|lThe morning star is the last star in the heavens before day and is a lone watcher. When you invoke a Miracle and roll the minimum amount, you don’t lose any Favor.|3Sun|lThe sun is the lord of heaven, strong and unbending, its power unquestioned. When you invoke a Miracle and roll the max amount, you don’t lose any Favor.|3Cyclical|pOften hailing from older, more primitive times, the Cyclical deity represents earthly inevitabilities in a dichotomy, sometimes with themselves and sometimes with an opposing deity. This can be Spring and Summer, life and death, creation and destruction. They may be weak now, but they will wax unstoppable. When you invoke a Miracle, and roll under its average, your next Miracle gains a +1. This is cumulative.|lIf you roll above its average, this bonus is then removed, and you get a -1 to your next Miracle. Again, this is cumulative and resets when you roll below.|lSo, if you have a d6! Honor Dice, and you roll a 2, the next Miracle you invoke gets a +1. That next Miracle you roll, you get a 3 for a total of 4 (because of the +1), giving you a +2 the next roll. On that roll, you roll a 5 for a total of 7 ( 5 + 2 ). The next Miracle you then invoke gets a -1|
