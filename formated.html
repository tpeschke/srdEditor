    <p>If you’re not excited, bellying up to the table every session is going to be a chore and you’ll disengage from
        whatever is going on in the campaign. Most people are good at this already but it’s important to not lose sight
        of this qualification when you’re juggling the others. </p>

    <p>Going forward, it is on you to be proactive about finding things that inspire you but that also jive with
        everyone else at the table. But this is an ongoing process because the mistake that many players make is that
        they build a character they think they want to play but then end up not enjoying.</p>

    <p>And this isn’t their fault; it could be the result of the setting, campaign, the system, or all three. It can
        also come from you getting excited about a new character or just getting bored of the same old same old. You can
        lose the ‘why’ of what excites you about the character. This is especially true of long campaigns.</p>

    <p>You can, of course, ask your GM if you can remake your character or bring in a new one. If you have a stable of
        henchmen, this is easy (and one of the reasons that Bonfire implemented the system) but, if you’ve been
        neglecting that part of character advancement, ask your GM if you could run an allied NPC</p>

    <p>But this doesn’t have to be permanent; you can bring in the new character as a ‘guest’ character that you run for
        an adventure or a few sessions before flipping back to your old character. You can even tie them to locations -
        when in the city of Hoffinlau, you pay the rogue, Irna, while your main character visits with their parents.

    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'WhatseparatesGZvzStDzfs'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>What separates a solid character from a great character is the GM being excited about them. Good GMs are fans of
        your character but they are human. Most importantly, the GM is running a game because they’re excited about the
        world, the adventure, the campaign and you don’t want to squash that excitement.</p>

    <div id='IfyoucreatehFvwacFzoy' class='anchorTag'></div>
    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'IfyoucreatehFvwacFzoy'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>If you create a character that the GM isn’t excited about, it’s going to cause a few problems. The first, for
        you, is that the GM won’t get involved in your character’s story which will mean that they’ll see less of the
        spotlight and you’ll lose out on things like story beats and treasure designed for your character.</p>

    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'BeyondthatiitOrQfwPgg'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>Beyond that, if your GM isn’t onboard with your character, you could end up squashing their excitement for the
        adventure or campaign, which will lead them to burn out and wrapping up the game quickly, which means that it
        doesn’t matter how excited you are to play your character; you won’t get to play them.</p>

    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThefirstistdtzAdUYphq'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>The first is that you need to understand the setting and tone of the campaign and then build a character concept
        to support it. You can’t expect the GM to even like your character if you don’t pay attention to the setting
        they build or the adventure they’ve made, which is what the GM is excited about.</p>

    <p>Include your GM in character creation; ask for input and ideas. See which ideas in the game they’re running that
        they’re excited for and then see where it overlaps with what you’re excited for.</p>

    <p>It’s natural that, when one is given a boundary, to want to push against it or be an exception because it’s a way
        of making us stick out and feel special. Resist that urge; if your GM says that the campaign is only orcs, be an
        orc. There are other, limitless, ways to be special within restrictions. If your GM has buy-in with your
        character, they’ll be looking for ways to make them special.</p>

    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'OnamorepracMjSviTIfMS'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>On a more practical side, don’t make a character who is good at everything. Try to have at least one weakness for
        each type of challenge; combat, social, and skill. Your GM wants to challenge you because that can make for a
        compelling character. If the GM is struggling to challenge you, they will get burnt out; they’re already doing a
        ton of work so try not to make their job harder.</p>

    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'HavingweaknesjBxvWDPtMI'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>

    <p>GMs don’t want to squash your enthusiasm for the game because that excitement is important so many will pretend
        to be excited about your character concept or just give their approval rather than try and tease out a
        compromise. Finding middle ground is hard and your GM already has a lot on their plate but they might also have
        been hurt by previous players who were needlessly belligerent and selfish so be patient with them and look for
        these warning signs:</p>

    <p>I loved my first character to death but it wasn’t until years later when I was talking about old stories and
        adventures with the GM, “Mark”, that ran the character, that I discovered something. I mentioned that I loved
        that character but that Mark seemed to have disengaged from them at some point. </p>

    <p>Mark got visibly mad; He explained that he loved that character too but because I, in my excitement to play the

    <p>Admittedly, this is the least important section but it’s still important. It can also be the easiest because the
        bar is low; the other players don’t have to be excited about your character - they don’t even have to know your

    <p>This can basically be summed up with “do the other players know what your character brings to the table?” Other
        players need to know what your character’s utility to them is and their characters. When they know that, they

    <p>If they don’t, at best, you’ll find your character excluded from the action; when they make plans, they won’t
        include your character. When they talk about things, you might find you, as a player, not included. If you’re
        lucky, they’ll talk to you about this but, often, they won’t and you’ll find yourself on the outside looking in.
