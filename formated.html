    <p>I wanted to take a small aside to talk about meaningful failure because, if there isn’t a chance of it it is the

    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'AnexampleIsebgvtcPaDw'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>An example I see all the time is GMs putting the adventure hook behind a check. A man has a job for the players

    <p>For me, personally, it also inflicts doubt in my actual agency as a player. Did I really beat the villain because
        of what I did or did the GM just fudge the outcome because that’s what they wanted?</p>

</div>
<div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'TheresthereSYkNASvrVU'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>There’s the resolution mechanic (how do I determine success or failure) but what that resolution mechanic means
        is based in the context of what is going on.</p>
</div>
<div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
    <div id='ForinstancecxKCfoIoOy' class='anchorTag'></div>
    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ForinstancecxKCfoIoOy'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>For instance, rolling an attack roll in a combat means you’re trying to physically hit someone or something with
        your weapon with the intent to kill or subdue while rolling to attack in an interrogation scene is more about
        striking to scare rather than wound.</p>
</div>
<div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
    <div id='ThatcontextiLMPQXvyZgF' class='anchorTag'></div>
    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThatcontextiLMPQXvyZgF'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>That context is often nested in a structure. For instance, the combat is nested in the “Combat” structure which
        determines how often that attack can be made while the interrogation scene doesn’t work when you run it like a
        combat.</p>

    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ButalotofgzFftTArLyJ'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>But a lot of games don’t give you structures to run different types of scenes: they don’t give you the structure
        that helps you (and your players) play that interrogation scene out.</p>

        you can use for 3 very different types of scenes.</p>

    <p>You’ll notice an exclamation mark (!) behind a lot of dice notations. This marks the dice as exploding, which
        means that should the maximum of that dice is rolled, you get to roll it again, this time with a - 1, and add
        what you rolled to the total.</p>

    <p>So, if you roll a 3d8! for damage, you get a 5, 8, 8. Since you rolled the maximum value on two of your dice, you
        roll those dice again, and roll an 8, and 5, giving you a subtotal of 32 ( 5 + 8 + 8 + 8 - 1 + 5 - 1 ) but since
        you rolled another 8, you get to roll that dice again, and you get a 1, netting you a 0 ( 1 - 1 ).</p>

    <p>The second thing is that explosion dice don’t add additional dice to the number. So, in the example above, all
