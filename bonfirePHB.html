    <div id="exportContent"><h5>Character Creation</h5><h1>1. ROLL STAT SCORES</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character has 6 attributes that define your character physically and mentally. These are Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intellect (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha). More on details are found in <strong>Chapter 2: Stat Scores.</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"> Roll 3d6 for each of these Abilities to generate that score.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This should result in something similar to this:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Str: 13</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Dex: 7</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Con: 10</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Int: 14</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Wis: 11</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Cha: 6</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Bonfire is specifically balanced for you to roll 3d6 in order, with 10 being the average result but you’ll have the chance to modify these later so don’t worry too much if you have low scores.</p><h1>2. RECIEVE CrP</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Alright, you have your scores. Now it’s time to decide whether or not if you can reroll them. At this point you’re also going to determine how many Creation Points (or CrP, for short) you’ll start with. These CrP will be spent on modifying your character; buying them their skills and increasing their Scores. They may also be spent on rerolls at certain steps.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> If you have no score over 13, or 2 under 6, you may choose to reroll for free. Your character just didn’t have it in him to go adventuring.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If that’s not the case and you still want to reroll your stats, you can but you receive 0 CrPs to work with and you’re stuck with your second set of Scores.</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Even still, you may want to switch your stats around. This may be because you have almost the right stats but you have a specific character concept in mind. For instance, using the example stats in Step 1, your party may need a diplomatic character more than a strong character. In this case, it would really help to swap Strength and Charisma.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You can freely switch around your stats as need but, in that case, you only receive 25 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If you switch only 4 of your stats, you receive 50 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If you switch 2, you receive 75 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And if you keep your stats the way they are, with no changes, you gain 100 CrPs to work with.</p><h1>3. SELECT RACE</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character’s race will change how they interact with the world and what they’ll be good and bad at so pick carefully.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Details are found in <strong>Chapter 3: Races</strong> so go there and pick one and come back here when you’re done.</p><h1>4. CHOOSE YOUR ARCHETYPES</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character’s class is made of two Archetypes combined.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You choose a Primary and a Secondary Archetype and pay the price in CrP for both based on your race’s Archetype Cost section. Descriptions of the different Archetypes are found in <strong>Chapter 4: Archetypes</strong> along with more details on how to combined them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve chosen to reroll your stats and have no CrPs to work with, congratulations, you’re now in CrP debt and need to make it up by the end of Character Creation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You must select two Archetypes before going further.</p><h1>5. RECORD ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is more for Caster Archetypes, as they’ll head over to <strong>Chapter 12: The Weird</strong> to roll their starting spells but now is the time to record any free Skills, or Masteries you obtained free from your class choice, as well as Class Abilities</p><h1>6. ROLLS FLAWS</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> All heroes have flaws. That’s what makes them relatable and human (even if they’re an orc). Character Flaws earn you additional CrP, which is great. Flaws can also be used in social situations to further the story.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> For a list of Flaws flip to <strong>Chapter 5: Flaws.</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve gone into CrP debt and you’re not out of it by the end of this stage, you’ll need to go back and reselect your Archetypes so that you are or go back to you starting set of stats and begin Character Creation all over again with them.</p><h1>7. ADJUST STATS</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Now, it is time to do the final adjustments to your stats. While not your final adjustments: you'll have a chance to increase them again level up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The price to increase a Stat is the Stat + 10. So, to get a Stat to 9 from 8, it would cost 18 CrP.</p><h1>8. CALCULATE CHARACTER VITALS</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Now it’s time to calculate your character’s Honor and Vitality.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> These 2 things, along with Stress are important parts of the game and serve as the prime mechanics when running a Bonfire game. If you’re not familiar with them head over to <strong>Chapter 6: Character Vitals.</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This chapter will also give you an overview of the character sheet that you’ll get more acquainted with later. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve already played Bonfire before, here’s a cheat sheet for calculating those things:</p><ul><li>Honor: This is determined by your “Starting Honor” listed under your Charisma</li><li>Vitality: This is Con score + Primary Archetype’s Vitality Die + Vitality Size Modifier from race, divided into 4 Categories.</li></ul><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Don't forget that you get a bonus to your CrP from the Honor of your last character. If this is your first character, you instead get 25 CrP. Enjoy.</p><h1>9. MASTERIES & SKILLS</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Masteries and Skills are additional areas of expertise that your character has obtained above his or her race and class.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> All three cost CrP. Prices and descriptions can be found in <strong>Chapter 8: Skills.</strong></p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class="sidebarTitle">Out of Order Character Creation</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’re a little bit more familiar with Bonfire Character creation, these last steps (step 9, 10, and 11) can be taken in any order you’d like, even skipping back and forth between them.</p></td></tr></table><h1>10. DEFINE SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your character is more than just raw stats, skills, and abilities. At this step, you’re going to define more about who they see themselves as and how others perceive them by defining their Traits, Passions, Goals, and Devotions. Jump to <strong>Chapter 9: Social.</strong></p><h1>11. BUY EQUIPMENT</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Every character starts with a kit of gear, which has a list of per purchased starting gear as well as an extra bit of starting cash they you can spend on additional things. Proceed to <strong>Chapter 11: Equipment</strong> for a full list of available kits and gear you can pick up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You may also cash in any left over CrP for sp at 1 CrP for 10 sc, but you don’t have to. You can save your CrP to spend later at your level up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After purchasing your equipment, adjust your Encumbrance. Don’t forget that armor and shields will also modify this.</p><h1>12. TRANSFER TO CHARACTER SHEET</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Congratulations: you’re on the home stretch! Finish your character off by transferring your notes to a fresh character sheet, an example of which, with a break down, is found in <strong>Chapter 6: Character Vitals.</strong> You can also find a download for the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L8hQ38ZjLbn9E_CDqVb6_rKG-uG_5yGX/view">character sheet here.</a></p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class="sidebarTitle">Exploding Dice</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You’ll notice a exclamation mark (!) behind a lot of dice notations. This marks the dice as exploding, which means that should the maximum of that dice is rolled, you get to roll it again, this time with a - 1, and add what you rolled to the total.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This continues for as long as you roll the maximum dice, however, the - 1 always stays a -1 one. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, if you roll a 3d8! for damage, you get a 5, 8, 8. Since you rolled the maximum value on two of your dice, you roll those dice again, and roll an 8, and 5, giving you a subtotal of 32 ( 5 + 8 + 8 + 8 - 1 + 5 - 1 ) but since you rolled another 8, you get to roll that dice again, and you get a 1, netting you a 0 ( 1 - 1 ).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are two things you should be aware of: 1d100! explode to a 1d20!, while 1d20! explode to a d6!.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The second thing is that explosion dice don’t add additional dice to the number. So, in the example above, all that damage is only counted as having been done with 3 dice (instead of the 5 that were actually rolled).</p></td></tr></table><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class="sidebarTitle">Dice Size Hierarchy</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Bonfire plays around a lot with dice sizes, so it’s important to know what dice to grab in those cases.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Dice sizes go as follows:</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d2 → d3 → d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12 → d20</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If a d4 is exploding and drops to a d3 or lower, it stops exploding.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If the dice size increases past a d20, you’ll add an extra dice starting at a d4. Further dice sizes will increase this smaller dice. This can continue ad nauseum, but no matter how many dice there are, they’re always considered to be rolled on 1 dice.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, 3d20! + d10! is still considered 1 dice.</p></td></tr></table><h5>Stat Scores</h5><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Stat Scores represent different dimensions of your character and how good their baseline is at certain activities. These dimensions are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intellect, Wisdom, Charisma.</p><h1>STAT CHECKS</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> There many come a time where a Skill Check doesn’t exactly cover what needs to be tested. What skill covers trying to deadlift a boulder or remember a fact about a person? When skills fail and it’s simply a raw test of an ability, Stat Checks come into play. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Players making an unopposed ability check roll a d20 and try to get a result equal to or under their their stat score. If the check is made at 1/2 the score, they're trying to roll equal to or under their score, rounded down. Should they do so, they succeed.</p><h3>OPPOSED CHECKS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Opposed checks work almost the same. The player rolls a d20! + their relevant stat score vs an opposing d20! + any relevant modifiers (such as the boulder being really heavy or only their foes relevant stat score). The person with the higher total succeeds.</p><h1>STRENGTH</h1><table style="width:240px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="5" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Strength </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Score</td><td>Damage</td><td>Carry</td><td>Skill</td><td>Social</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>-4</td><td>1S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>-3</td><td>2S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td>-3</td><td>1M</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td>-3</td><td>1M 1S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5</td><td>-2</td><td>1M 2S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6</td><td>-2</td><td>2M</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>7</td><td>-1</td><td>2M 1S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>8</td><td>-1</td><td>2M 2S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>9</td><td>-1</td><td>1L</td><td>1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>1L</td><td>1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>1L</td><td>1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>1L 1S</td><td>1</td><td>D4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>13</td><td>1</td><td>1L 2S</td><td>1</td><td>D4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>1L 1M</td><td>2</td><td>D6!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>15</td><td>2</td><td>1L 1M 1S</td><td>2</td><td>D6!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>1L 1M 2S</td><td>2</td><td>D8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>17</td><td>3</td><td>1L 2M</td><td>2</td><td>D8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>18</td><td>3</td><td>1L 2M 1S</td><td>2</td><td>D10!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>19</td><td>3</td><td>1L 2M 2S</td><td>3</td><td>D12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>20</td><td>4</td><td>2L</td><td>3</td><td>D20!</td></tr><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Strength (Str) represents your character’s pure brawn. How much can she lift and carry? How strong are her punches?</p><h3>DAMAGE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number is added to your damage whenever your character hits something with their fits or uses thrown ranged weapons. It’s the raw, physical force he can put into an object.</p><h3>CARRY</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number represents the number of items a character can carry in their hands before he gets more Encumbered. More on Encumbrance is found in <strong>Chapter 11: Equipment.</strong></p><h3>SKILL</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number represents the discount you apply to Skill costs whenever you buy a Skill with this as a listed Stat.</p><h3>SOCIAL DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sometimes your character’s strength can play into social situations, such as trying to intimidate your opponent.

Can she dodge arrows or can she execute a graceful pirouette? Dexterity is crucial for avoiding blows in combat or traps in a hallway.</p><h3>ATTACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Being graceful allows your character to take advantage of openings others can’t. This number gets added to all attack rolls your character makes.</p><h3>DEFENCE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you can move quicker than your opponent, you can often get out of harm’s way before it becomes a problem. This number gets added to all melee defense rolls your character makes.</p><h3>INITIATIVE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Another bonus of being quick on your feet is the ability to get moving quicker when manure hits the windmill. This number gets added to your initiative rolls at the beginning of combat.</p><h3>SKILL</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number represents the discount you apply to Skill costs whenever you buy a Skill with this as a listed Stat.</p><h3>SOCIAL DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sometimes your character’s dexterity can play into social situations, such as trying to seduce your opponent.

Can he shrug off the Dancing Death or does he succumb to a head cold? Can she take a solid blow in combat and not even blink? These are the things Constitution oversees.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Constitution is the base of your starting Vitality so don’t neglect it.</p><h3>MIN VITALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Every other level, a character gains a reroll of their Vitality Die.

The Painted World was mutable and the source of all magic and there the First Children lived happily, beautiful, skilled, and perfect in everyway.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> They were the delight of all the Divines, save one: the trickster Divine, Rostam. Rostam quickly grew bored of the First Children and the constant fawning they received from the Divines.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> And so, under the guise of creating servants for the Divines, he created the Dwarves. He made the opposite of the First Children - crude, mean, ugly, and incorrigible in the extreme. They caused such an uproar in the Higher Realm that the Divines banished them to the Nothing beyond the Gate of Heaven, where certain death awaited them in the embrace of non-existent nothing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The Father of the Dwarves took his people and before passing through the Gate of Heaven, slew the giant Ymir, who stood guard there and tossed his body into the Nothing. The All-Father and his sons jumped from the Gate and onto Ymir and from his bones they made the Middle Realm; the giant’s blood, the oceans and his muscles, the earth.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> There they lived a profane life, in defiance of the Divines. With the protection of the Bones of Ymir, the dwarves were able to avoid the direct displeasure of the Divines and so the Divines needed to think of different ways to reach them in their holds.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> They created the Bonfire, links to the Higher Realm, through which they sent the unthinking evils of the world through but the dwarves repulsed them.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> And so they created their Second Children, avenging angels robed in flesh, to travel through the Bonfires and war with the dwarves.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> But after centuries of war, the Second Children changed: they became obsessed with the total destruction of the dwarves and so they chained themselves to the Bonfires, harnessing the Divine against its wills. They became the orcs.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Appalled at what their Children had become, the Divines sent their First Children to bring the orcs back into the fold, but the orcs rebelled, sacrificing some of the First Children on the Bonfires and thus was born the human race.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Centuries have passed and the Middle Realm changes those that walk there. The First Children eventually called it home and became the elves.</p><h1>WHICH RACE SHOULD I CHOOSE?</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your race effects character creation in 3 ways: Stat Score Modifiers, Gameplay Rewards, and Archetype Costs. If you're new to RPGs in generally, go for a race that interests you based on the flavor.</p><h3>STAT SCORE MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These modify the base stats that you roll. You can use it to balance out your character's weak spots or you can use it to maximize what your character is already good it. We recommend the latter as Bonfire is a game built around teamwork: you'll have friends who will be good at things your character isn't.</p><h3>GAMEPLAY REWARDS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each race is meant to encourage a certain type of play. For instance, orcs gain bonuses for starting things, like combats or social conflicts, so they reward players who are aggressive, while elves get rewarded for being careful with how they engage with others. These are noted under the Racial Temperament section in their summary. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Some races can spend less time mastering things than others, freeing up time (CrP) to focus on other pursuits or becoming true masters of their vocation. This is reflected in the Archetype Costs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You'll notice that some races will have Archetype Exceptions: these are based on the lore of that race for the Middle Realm, the official campaign setting of Bonfire. GMs should feel free to modify these prices. Actually, GMs should modify any prices to fit their setting.</p><h1>RACIAL PREFERENCES</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Racial tensions exist in the Middle Realm and there’s bad blood between the different species, plus, some races get on other's nerves because of differing temperaments.

The elf, realizing that this is going to be harder than it needs to be because of the orcs bullheadedness and general lack of forethought, goes to the his human friend and tries to get him to sign on. Because humans like elves, the elf would get a d6! to convince him instead. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Orcs treat their own kin as Preferred for Racial Preferences.</p><h1>CHANGELINGS</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Changeling Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> -4 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +2 Dex</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> +3 Wis</p><p style="margin:0px;">Small Sized (- 1 ft to Measure, +3 to Melee & Ranged Defense, less movement, and require less food)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 10</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Crafty</p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 20</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Caster: 15<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 15</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 25</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Changelings are strange little beings. The rumors are that their demons who've trade places with human children left out in the wild or that they're the stillborn children of wizards and witches. Either way, their wiliness and techincal prowess make them welcome guests where every they end up. </p><h3>HISTORY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Changelings were said to first appear in the employ of hedge wizards and witches in the hinterlands of the Rhon mountains. They were usually attached to a village, where they worked as tinkers and menders, or as helpers in workshops. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> During the spread of the First Empire, many officials specifically went out and drafted them, recruiting them as armours, sappers, or magic-users in the army or household artists, as they had a keen artistic eye and creative spirit. They formed their own communities and many bought their freedom, seeking their own way in the world but many stayed as it was a good gig. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> As the First Empire fell, many changelings simply integrated into the local culture. Those that didn't often found themselves the target of persecution, accused of being traitors to the Empire or simply scapegoated for their unwillingness to give up their culture. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> With the rise of the Second Empire, they have, however, once again found a safe place in the machinary of state, but many still long for the quiet life in a tucked away community where they can tinker and mend away. </p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Changelings are about the size of a 10 year old human, with extremely pale skin, unsually long fingers and large eyes. Besides this, they appear like little humans, with whispy hair on their head and face. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They dress in whatever the area custom is but tend towards bright and clashing colors. </p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Changelings are wily and crafty, and, while not lacking in morality, tend to get caught up on whatever project they're currently on. They enjoy puzzles more than anything - the thrill of having everything click into place just perfectly is the finest thing a person can experiance. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also tend to be on the shy side, as much as possible, keeping out of the limelight. Worldly power and accolades hold little appeal for them, but there is a sense of wanting to be apart something greater than keeps them reaching out to the outside world. </p><h1>DWARVES</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Dwarf Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> -3 Dex</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +4 Con</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> -2 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Small Sized (- 1 ft to Measure, +3 to Melee & Ranged Defense, less movement, and require less food)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 20</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Unconquerable</p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 15<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 35</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Caster: n/a<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 25</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 10</strong></p><h3>Archetype Exceptions</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Paragon Acolyte: 20</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Symbolist: 20</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Dwarves are called the 'Stonemen' not because they're made of stone but because they're hard as rock. They're obstinate and incorrigible and, as a rule, they never do anything that someone else wants them to do. As such, they're the most disagreeable beings in the Middle Realm. They're also the most straightforward, brave, and loyal beings as well. </p><h3>HISTORY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Dwarves were made by the Divine Rostam for one purpose: to try and get the other Divines to stop huffing their own farts and realize their not infalible. As such, he took their favorite children, those beings that would become the elves, and flipped them on their head. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Needless to say, when these little buggers became running around the Higher World, the other Divines were not amused and quickly tried to get rid of them by banishing them to the Void. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Well, the dwarves were not going to be beaten so easily. After all, any one could be sentenced to non-existance by being throwing into the endless Nothing. So, they slew the guardian, Ymir, and threw his body into the Nothing and thus created the Middle Realm. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> The rest of dwarven history is filled with the Divine's futile attempts to scrub them from the world but finally as the gods began to relax and realize how much they overracted, the Dwarves soon found themselves fighting amongst themselves. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Currently, they've ditched their isolation policy and have begun to interact with the outside world. </p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Dwarves are the opposite of elves. They're short, barrel chested with thick hair growing all over their bodies. This hair ranges from coal black to a golden hue, depending on which hold the dwarf hails from. They also always support big bushy beards that are near hard as steel. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> These beards are their pride and joy and they take great care in them. Woven into each beard is the tale of that dwarf's life and accomplishments as well as their job within the hold. You can learn a lot from reading a dwarf's beard. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Besides this and their tools, the dwarves really don't take care of themselves, eschewing anything showy or fancy, like nice fabrics or baths. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Dwarf anatomy is, thankfully, a mystery to most outsiders. All dwarves, to other races, appear human and use human pronouns, though in dwarvish, their are no pronouns because that's more bothersome. There is a rumor that their are female dwarves but that there's 0 sexual dimorphism in the species, which makes courting a very careful affair, but the running theory is that female dwarves are just anvils. </p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> As stated before, dwarves are subborn. They're very rarely, however, psychopathically so. More often, once they have decided something, they tend to get defencive and refuse to relent unless they absolutely have to. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> This makes dwarven governments and social structures very slow moving and difficult to work with but, it also means that if you get a dwarf to agree with you, they will happily die on that hill. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> In fact, the only time that a dwarf seems to be happy is when he's being stubborn about something. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Finally, dwarves do not ascribe to social niceties. It's not that they're incapabile to understanding them or aware of them: they just don't think they're worth paying attention to, in the same way that most people don't notice insects. </p><h1>ELVES</h1><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Elf Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> -2 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -4 Con</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +4 Int</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> +2 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Medium Sized</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 10</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Patient</p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 15<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 15</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Caster: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 10</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 20</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Elves are the first born of the Divines. Originally, the inhabitants of the Painted World, the source of all magic, they now inhabit the Middle Realm as mentally ethereal beings.</p><h3>HISTORY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> After the corruption of the Orcs, the Divines sought another means of assailing the Dwarves in their holds. They turned to the First Children, the Elves.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, they marshaled the elven forces and invaded the Middle Realm.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The invasion proved more fruitful than the first one. The Elves’ ethereal nature allowed them to interact with the Middle Realm without being corrupted by it and their corporeal bodies allowed them to wage war on the Dwarves on their own terms.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> But there were side effects of their new environment. The Elves, who used to be nearest to the Divines, found that they were now less connected to their creators. With all that reality in the way, their prayers had a harder time of reaching the Divines.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After generations, the Elves have become dispersed, their common cause mostly forgotten and their heritage lost to the mists of time. Some continue the war, but most of them have integrated into the societies of the Middle Realm as artisans, scholars, and wizards.</p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Elves are slender beings that are widely considered classically beautiful, though many find their features alien and off putting. They uniformly have long ears that taper to a point at the end.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Their eyes are pure white, with no iris or pupil visible, this matched with their sharp teeth, can give them a feline turn to their face.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Elves naturally survive off the ebb and flow of magic that drifts through the air of the Painted World. While still present in the Middle Realm, these winds are a sliver of their natural magnitude and so Elves need to find other sources; the main one being through the magic inherent in all living creatures. While vegetables do have magic in them, an Elf would have to consume 100s of pounds of lettuce each day to not die of starvation. The only realistic way of getting enough magic to survive is through the consumption of raw meat. </p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> To describe an Elf as “careful” would be a huge understatement. They tend to live longer than other races, not because some supernaturally long lifespan, but because they're always careful about their actions. They see other races as brash and impetuous while they're in turn seen as slow and cowardly. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> It's not they're incapable of great emotion or quick action but elves seem to understand that with every action comes a consquence, whether that action was well meaning or not, and that this karmic force is more powerful than any other law or power. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> However, once set on a course, it is hard to dissaude an elf, for they do nothing lightly.</p><h1>GAUNTS</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Gaunt Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> -2 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +2 Dex</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -3 Con</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -3 Int</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +2 Wis</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> +3 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Medium Sized</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 10</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Salvation Secured</p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 35</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Caster: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 10</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 10</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Gaunts are said to be depraved creatures stuck between life and death. They love filthy lucre more than what made them human. They're those that, for whatever reason, have sold part of their souls for either money or at a change at eternal life in the world to come. </p><h3>HISTORY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> During the last days of the Old Vyatichi Kingdom, those with the power sought a way to cheat death and become immortal. While they didn't find the cure, they found a bandage: soul shiving, the process of grafting a piece of another's soul onto one's own to prolong your life. The priests and shamans talked about the gift they would give those who did this: how a piece of their soul would travel with them to heaven after death, granting even the vilest sinner reprieve. They also offered a hefty pay bonus too. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> And thus the first gaunts were born as the husks of those that sought a shortcut to salvation. Once the Empire took over, they outlawed the practices but it couldn't be undone, not the ritual or the knowledge and certain government officials also partook until it was an open secret. Many became man servants or thralls to these officials, pulled by some invisible thread together. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Crack downs by the Orthodoxy, both on practioners and gaunts themselves took place, with many going into hiding while others were rounded up into ghettoes. Many were burned at the stake during the last years of the Empire. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Not that the gaunts seemed to care. With salvation in the next world secured, most lived riot, indulging in the most depraved and headless way possible. Forming gangs and joining outcasts, becoming actors, and living life as if every day was their last. This, along with the church's indictment, only further estranged them from society. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And so on the edges of those societies they live, for the most part. Joining acting troopes or sellsword companies and generally making their way in the world where they can find a place to live out their final mortal days. </p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Gaunts of all races look generally the same as the soul shiving process drains them of their vitality. Their skin turns ghost white, their hair a weak grey, and their eyes become milky as if they're blind. Their bodies becoming desiccated, thin and reedy. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> They still need to eat, drink, and do other bodily functions - they are, even after all that, living. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Gaunts tend to dress in flamboyent clothing that is a mix and match of whatever they kind find. Most say this is because they loot the clothing off of those they kill but it's more likely because they just wear what they can find or because they wish to make up for their dull color palette </p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> As stated, gaunts get a bad rep for being wholely without morals but that's not always the case. Some have undergone the process because they need to feed thier families or out of a powerful sense of devotion or religious zeal so actually gaunts run the spectrum of personality types: they're just saddled with their reputation because of an admittedly not small section of them. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> What makes up the gaunt's personality is why he made the sacrifice to do what he did. Why was so precious to him that he would make such a huge sacrifice for? That's a complicated question and not easy to answer by the gaunt player should have their answer before play begins. </p><h1>HUMANS</h1><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Human Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Medium Sized</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 15</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">We all have our theories on what personality traits that are shared by the human race and I'm not interested in wading in on that debate so instead of having a Racial Temperament, Humans increase their Honor Dice by 1 size. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 10</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Caster: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 10</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 10</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Humans are the first natives of the Middle Realm.

Orc warlords discovered they could strengthen and corrupt the Bonfires by burning Elves alive in the its flame.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> But out of the remains rose new life: a creature of both heaven and earth.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> These children of the Middle Realm survived by forming clans in the hills and mountains, away from the fighting, and there they began to thrive.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The turning point in their civilization was when the Divines discovered their unique connection with the Humans. Each Human carried a Bonfire inside them, making them perfect vessels for the favor of the gods. The Divines began focusing their attention on them and bestowing their gifts on their adopted children.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Humans have now become the preeminent race in the Middle Realm, with kingdoms and empires across the world.</p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> The Humans of the Middle Realm look like you and me.

Through the Bonfire they've formed a New Covenant with the Divines, remaking their minds in their image. They were the founders of the First Empire and their legacy is still cleaved to by the kings of the age. </p><h3>HISTORY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> The rise of the minotaurs trace their origin back to the Sack of Um Badr, an event that, at the time only mattered to the Beja, but would have world changing consquences. Details are sketchy since beastmen are barbaric and don't keep records but the story goes that using the Bonfire in the city, the minotaurs were able to forge a New Covenant with the Divines, granting them almost human intelligence. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> From there, the minotaurs organized themselves together and swept through the Rhon, subjegating the tribes there, overrunning the dwarven hold and learning all that they could. And like that, the First Empire was born. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Like an unstoppable tide, it conquered most of the known world - bringing all under one banner. And so there was an age of peace undreamed off. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> But it wouldn't last: minotaurs, while inspired warriors and generals, have no real strong talent for statecraft. Religious revivials, both at home and abroad caused cultural and population shifts that destablized the government. Rich merchants were soon flexing their power over officials, with wanton corruption investing all levels. It was all too much and the Empire cracked and fell apart. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Now there are minotaur kingdoms dotted the land, powerful but small states, but most make there way in other's lands. Still, there legacy lives on with their symbols still used by burgeoning states, event those founded by their traditional enemies. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> But, alas, the new Empire that now conqueres only pays lip service to them and is founded by humans who seek to be associated with bygone ages. </p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Minotaurs are huge creatures that are half man and half bull. Specifically, the head and upper torse, as well as the legs are bull, while the chest, shoulders, and arms are those of a man. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Both male and female are larger than the average person, with males standing on average about 7 ft tall and the woman standing at around 6 ft tall. Males sprout horns, though they lack the strength to effectively gore with them like their bull counterparts. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Their skin color, as well as their fur color and pattern, vary by region, with traditionall tanner skinned minotaurs coming from the south and light skinned ones coming from the north but during the days of the First Empire there was so much population movement that this is a trend rather than a rule. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Note that Minotaurs are more closely related to Beastfolk than they are to cows and so are, in fact, carnivorous. </p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Minotaurs cut royal figures and their personalities match. They have an extreme sense of pride and a great depth of feeling in accordance with their beastial nature. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They're extremely devoted to whatever cause they throw their weight behind and there is no difference to them between their opinions and themselves, making them very cocksure. This can, unsurprisingly, make them bullies as they care little for other's opinions about things. </p><h1>ORCS</h1><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Orc Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> +4 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +3 Con</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -4 Int</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> -4 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Medium Sized</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 15</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Aggressive</p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 20<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 25</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Caster: 20<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 30</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 10</strong></p><h3>Archetype Exceptions</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Priest: n/a: Shaman: 20</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Avenging angels who know how to make war like others know how to breathe.

If it doesn’t allow them to get a leg up on their enemy, why bother with it?</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The issue is that they don’t really have common sense: if it doesn’t directly relate to warfare, they don’t see the benefit.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, weapons and armor, sure, but growing food? I don’t see how it gives me the leg up. Let others do it and I’ll just raid them for theirs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Orcs aren’t that much dumber than the average person but their brains tend to overheat when thinking about complex topics.</p><h1>RATFOLK</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Ratfolk Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> -6 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -4 Con</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +3 Wis</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> +5 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Small Sized (- 1 ft to Measure, +3 to Melee & Ranged Defense, less movement, and require less food)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 10</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Helpful</p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 20</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Caster: 15<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 15</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 25</strong></p><h3>Archetype Exceptions</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Noble: 40</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Ratfolk are social creatures. They love people and being around people. Others find them pleasant to be around. As such, Ratfolk can be found as diplomats, traders, and minstrals. </p><h3>HISTORY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Ratfolk were the result of advanced Bejaian magics. After the Gothic and Capatian rebels, a spirit of fear riot in the city-states that a similar uprising might quickly come so the need for loyal servants inspired some of the greatest magic-users of the age to begin work on creating a race of people specifically made to be amenable. Thus, the first ratfolk. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Under the Empire, ratfolk came into high demand and those the Beja were secretive with their secrets, they were happy to swap them for coin and thus the creatures spread all over the continent, mainly as house servants. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> They eventually became extremely well known for making excellent spies and were called in to defuse hostile situations, as if they radianted an innate calming aura. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> But magic is wily and it soon became clear that the ratfolk were cunning, desiring more out of life than just to play second fiddle to others and so they sold their skills to the dwarven holds and enemies of the Empire to gain their freedom and a level of automony. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And so the last Primarch of the Empire fell by ratfolk hands, putting the last nail in the coffin. </p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Ratfolk are smaller and slimmer than other races, with lithe, fur covered bodies that range from auburn to dark black. They have beady eyes and long tails. For the most part, they appear like their smaller cousins, though with lighter frames and opposible thumbs. </p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> As stated, ratfolk are people people. They're extremely social and, as a rule, are extroverted. They tend to be agreeable and try to get along with everyone but this shouldn't be taken as people pleasing or weak because ratfolk are clever - dangerously so. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> People tend to think that because ratfolk are so easy going that they're push overs and that they can be taken advantage of but ratfolk sees it as "I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine" kind of deal so they're not just going to do things to do things. They very much believe in the social contract, but their animal nature makes them ruthless as some points. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> In fact, ratfolk can be quite ruthless to those they deem outside their pack, which has earned them some reputation as having a herd mentality. For ratfolk the only war is total war. </p><h5>Archetypes</h5><p style="margin:0px;"> Archetypes represent your character’s background training and starting skills. Your character’s class is a gestalt of two Archetypes of your choosing.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Archetypes are divided into Archetype Categories: Expert, Caster, Servant, Socialite, and Fighter. These represent the overall theme of the individual Archetype. For instance, Fighter Archetypes tend to be good at things related to combat. So, if you’re looking to make a combat focused character, you can look there.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You choose a Primary and a Secondary Archetype and pay the price in CrP for both based on your race.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You use the Vitality Die, the Skills & Masteries, and the Primary Drawback sections from the Primary, and combine both Archetype Abilities section, though you remove 1 leveling ability from your Secondary Archetype.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> While you may want to double down into the exact same Archetype, Caster Archetypes are the only ones that you can do that with. You may choose two Archetypes from the same Category, however.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your GM may choose to reject an Archetype combination based on the fact that the two Archetypes don’t fit together thematically. So, while a Thief/Priest (Beast Covenant) might be really powerful because of the Beast Covenant’s Shape Changing ability, if there’s not a Patron of Thieves and Animals in the campaign world, you’re out of luck.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If two characters have the same ability, unless it says otherwise, those abilities stack.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Expert Archetypes are those that focus on real-world non-combat skills, as opposed to relying on the Divines or magic as a source of strength.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Expert Archetypes tend to rely on Intellect and Wisdom, primarily.</p><h1>ADVENTURER</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Adventures gain the most free skills of all Archetypes allowing for the largest breathe of knowledge, however, they’re cheaper skills. They can also help others, giving them a chance to try again at Skill Checks they fail.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d8</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Adventurers receive 2 free purchases of any two different, non-Lore Skill Suites. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HELPING HAND</strong> The Adventurer is not just about knowing things but also giving others a helping hand in times of need. When another person uses an Adventurer’s help, either as an Asset, or one of his Helper Skills or Preparation, they receive an additional +1 to their roll. This bonus increases by +1 for every 2 levels the Adventurer has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MIDDLE NAME: DANGER</strong> For the Adventurer, danger is calming and straightforward and that’s what they crave. Whenever an Adventurer takes damage, they can heal that amount of Stress. This doesn’t heal Stress from wounds, however. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Any < 7 CrP, 6)</strong> At first level and every level up, Adventurers receive 6 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skills under 7 CrP in base cost (before Skill Adept and Stat Score reduction) within either of the two Skill Suites he picked at first level. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL ADEPT</strong> This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Adventurers tend to eschew book smarts for street smarts: the Lore Skill Suite and any Lore Advanced Skills cost double.</p><h1>ASSASSIN</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Assassin is a master killer, gaining a chance to increase their damage against unaware opponents and being able silence helpless ones quickly. They're also masters of poison use, knowing how to most effectively apply their killer medicine.</p><h3>VITALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Assassins receive 1 free purchase of the Streetwise Skill Suite.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BACKSTAB</strong> When using any small melee weapon against an unaware target (one that is either not aware of your presence or one that is unaware that you, personally, mean harm to them), the Assassin’s damage explodes on the highest and second highest result. i.e., d4!s explode on natural 3s and 4s. They also gain an additional dice of damage every 2 levels when backstabbing, which doesn’t increase the total number of dice for /D armor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If an opponent flees and the Assassin is within half their weapon Recovery, they may Backstab using half their additional damage dice from this ability.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IMPROVED COUP de GRACE</strong> An Assassin has studied the weak parts of their target’s anatomy and can quickly make a killer strike. Coup de Graces only take 5 seconds. This is always done completely silent. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COOL HEADED </strong>Where others would get blustered, the Assassin stays cool, even when he’s stressing. When making a Skill Check, lower the base amount of Stress you get by 2.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILLED POISONER</strong> An Assassin has intimate knowledge of poisons and how to use them. When someone is poisoned by the Assassin, increase that poison's Lethality by 1 for every level that Assassion has obtained. </p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Being a trained killer is not an honorable profession and people don’t like murders around. If your profession becomes publicly known, you lose 5 Honor. </p><h1>MASTERMIND</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Mastermind is a plotter: preparing themselves and laying out plans before they step foot into the Skill Challenge. They get bonuses for utilizing all the options presented in the Strategies section, meaning that, by the time they step into the ring, they’re unbeatable in their element.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d6 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Masterminds receive 1 free purchase of Skill Suite of their choice.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FRIENDS in ALL PLACE </strong>A Mastermind has contacts and knows how to use them. When using an Asset, the Mastermind gains a +1 at first level and increases it by 1 for every level they’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>METHODICALLY MINDED </strong>If you’re careful with how you treat your equipment and come prepared, you can see yourself through a tough spot. You may pay 15 Stress so that you or others who use your equipment ignore the degradation of a piece of equipment you use on a Check. This Stress penalty is lowered by 1 every 3 levels down to a minimum of 3.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PREP PAYS OFF </strong>People take pride in having their plans work out, the Mastermind doubly so. Whenever a reroll from Preparation results in a success when the original roll would have caused a failure, the Mastermind receives 1 free use of their Honor Die for the rest of the Skill Challenge.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>The RIGHT TOOL for the RIGHT TIME </strong>If you’re careful with how you treat your equipment and come prepared, you can see yourself through a tough spot. Once per Skill Challenge and an additional time for every 2 levels they’ve obtained, ignore the degradation of a piece of equipment you use on a Check.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Any, 3)</strong> At first level and every level other up, Masterminds receive 3 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skill. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL ADEPT </strong>This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Failure means that the Mastermind didn’t plan as well as he should have. He gains an additional 2 Stress Dice at the end of any Skill Challenge for each Obstacle that he fails, even if he got what he wanted out of the Challenge. </p><h1>OPPORTUNIST</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There’s just something about these types of people that seem to warp probability in their favor. And those lucky few who use this to their advantage to go far.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">the higher of 2d6 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Opportunists gain the Skills & Masteries from their Secondary Archetype.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LUCKY </strong> The Opportunist is naturally blessed with the ability to get out of trouble and use that adrenaline that comes as death comes near to dodge the grim reaper and keep running. After the results are given, the Opportunist can take 2 Stress to modify his results by 1. These may be done with the following conditions:</p><ul><li>They can never be used to make you a better fighter. Stress gained this way can only be used to dodge death or escape a bad situation but never to make your character a superman. </li><li>The character must think of a situation that saves his rear end, something that happens to him that’s to his advantage. </li></ul><p style="margin:0px;">The key here is that it can’t be impossible but it can be highly improbable. The chandelier rope breaking right at that moment separating him from a blood thirsty guard, a pigeon flying across an archer’s view intercepting an arrow, etc. are all acceptable.</p><p style="margin:0px;">It can’t be the result of skill. Him deflecting the blade with his hand like a badass is right out.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Should the character be unable to think of a scenario that fits both of these criteria, he’s unable to gain Stress to save himself.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FALL FORWARD </strong>Some people seem to stubble into where they need to be, even when they completely fail. When the Opportunist fails a Check, takes damage, or loses a round, he gains a roll of his Honor Dice. This is limited to 1 initially (so failing a second roll won't do him any good at level 1), but for every 3 levels the Opportunist has obtained, he increases the max number of Honor Dice this ability gives him by 1.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NATURAL ADVANTAGE </strong>A Opportunist lives on his wits and his ability to use every advantage. At the start of every Combat, Conflict, or Skill Challenge, he may change one thing about the field for every 10 Stress he takes. These changes must be consistent with an overarching setting (he can’t choose to have the inn change to a ship or flood right at that moment but he can choose to have a convenient chair or barrel right behind one of his enemies or reposition himself next to the fighter).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Stress is lowered by 1 for every level he’s obtained, down to 3, though he may use this ability multiple times, but it doubles the Stress penalty each time he does so. This resets the next time he has the opportunity to heal Stress.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Luck is a top heavy thing: Opportunists don’t get their Vitality reroll every other level, however, they do get bumped up to their Min. Vitality from their Constitution if they’re below it. </p><h1>PROFESSIONAL</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While other Experts focus on knowledge, the Professional focuses on when to apply that knowledge and how to use their time effectively. The work with the Clocks of the Skill Challenge primarily, rather than being just good at Skill Checks. </p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d6 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Professionals receive 1 free purchase of Skill Suite of their choice.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>UNDER PRESSURE </strong>When times get tough, the tough get going and the Professional is tough. The first time an Obstacle becomes Active, you gain an additional use of your Honor Die for the remainder of the Conflict. This increases by 1 Honor Die for every level you’ve obtained and only happens once for each Obstacle.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BUYING TIME </strong>The sands of the hourglass trickle onward but sometimes you can slow it down for a moment or two. During a Skill Challenge on a failed Check, you can sacrifice Honor to increase your roll by 2. This can’t, however, turn the failure into a success.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WATCHING EACH OTHER’S BACK </strong>Whenever one does their job, everyone can rest easy. If two or more allies are Multitasker, they both get a +1 to one of their rolls for every 2 levels the Professional has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Any, 3)</strong> At first level and every level other up, Professional receive 3 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skill. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL ADEPT </strong>This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Professional is a man of reputation and so, when it is besmirched, it affects him gravely. For every 5 Honor you lose, lose an additional 1.</p><h1>RANGER</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Ranger’s strengths rely mostly in their survival skills, making them excellent to have in the wilderness but they also gain a bonus to their movement that allows them to out pace others during skirmishes. </p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d8</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Rangers receive 1 free purchase of the Survival Skill Suite.</p><h3>ARCHETYPES ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>QUICK FOOTED</strong> The Ranger relies on being able to cross great swaths of land quickly, chasing down their prey. At first level and for every 2 levels he’s obtained, the Ranger increases his base movement rate categories by 1 foot. He can't increase it again until all other movement categories have been increased in a like manner.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A first level Ranger can choose Stroll/Crawling, Walking, Jogging, Running, Sprinting. If he chooses Walking, his Walk becomes 6 ft / second. At level 3, he can chose Strolling/Crawling, Jogging, Running, or Sprinting, but not Walking. After he's increased all by 1 ft, he can go back and increase his Walk again.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PUT YOUR HEADS TOGETHER</strong> For survival, communication is key and doing so quickly is often extremely important. When using each other as Assets, all allies of the Ranger have their Investment Time start at 1 hour instead of 2 hours and 45 minutes.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Survival, 5)</strong> At first level and every level up, Rangers receive 5 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skills from the Survival Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL ADEPT</strong> This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Ranger finds armor restricting and irritating: all Armor Advanced Trainings are 2 CrP more expensive per Tier (Tier 1: 10 CrP, Tier 3: 22 CrP).</p><h1>SAGE</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Sage gets some of the most expensive and cerebral skills for free but also, because of his intense training, he has the ability to instantly reroll any skill he chooses.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sages receive 2 free purchases of the Lore Skill Suite</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MEMORY TRAINING</strong>The Sage’s training doesn’t just revolve around studying but also on how to study, allowing them better recall of information than those without such mental discipline. The Sage may reroll 1 Int, Wis, or Cha based Skill Check for 15 Stress. They may do this multiple times but each time they do so between opportunities where they can heal Stress costs them double, however, they also lower this Stress gain by 1 for every 2 levels they’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FRANK DISCUSSION </strong>You can often get more out of a discussion than you can simply thinking about something. When used as an Asset, the person receives a +1 to their Skill Check and an additional +1 for every 3 levels the Sage has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Lore, 5)</strong> At first level and every level up, Sages receive 5 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skill from the Lore Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL ADEPT</strong> This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Sage has spent most of his time buried in study and so may take a bit longer to react to reality: they always roll an initiative die 2 sizes larger. </p><h1>THIEF</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Thief has the widest variety of skills, picking from a uniquely built suite, rather than a predetermined one on top of their other free skills.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Thieves receive 2 free purchases of the Streetwise Skill Suite</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Gain Thieves Cant Mastery for free</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>THIEF’S TRAINING</strong> At first level and every 2 levels they obtain, the Thief receives 4 free purchases in Advanced Skill from the list found below. This can be doubled up into a single skill or spread between any number of them. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Thief's Training Skills</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A thief may choose from the following skills:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>- Appraisal (Specific): - Escape Artist</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>- Camouflage: - Hiding</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>- Climbing: - Law (Culture)</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>- Disarm Trap: - Scavenging</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>- Distraction: - Move Silently</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BROTHER/SISTERHOOD</strong> When you know others have your back and you have theirs, it’s much easier to keep your calm. Everyone increases their Stress Threshold by 5. This bonus increases by 3 for every 3 levels the Thief has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Streetwise, 3)</strong> At first level and every level up, Thieves receive 3 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skill from the Streetwise Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL ADEPT</strong> This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thieving is not an Honorable profession. A Thief loses 5 Honor should their profession become publicly known. </p><h1>WILDERMAN</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Wilderman is a savage by most standards. They tend to be those raised in the wild by feral creatures, or those mountain men that retreated to the frontier so long ago that they’ve lost the rounded edges that civilization originally bestowed on them. </p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d12 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Wilderman receive 2 free purchases of the Survival Skill Suite</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ANIMAL AFFINITY </strong>The Wilderman has a natural connection to the beasts. As such, he can form bonds with them quicker than humans. A Wilderman can use one of his followers at anytime to attract an environmentally appropriate animal companion instead.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You may never gain more than 1 animal companion at one time.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONING </strong>Being outside in all seasons and weather, hardens the Wilderman. He considers himself up to 40 degrees warmer or colder than the surrounding climate.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ONE PACK </strong>The Wilderman knows that you either survive together or die separately. Anyone can use anyone else’s Honor Dice, however they take Stress equal to what they roll on it.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ANIMAL FRIEND </strong>Being around animals allows you to really get in their head and communicate with them on a level that civilized people just can't. This ability allows the Wilderman to get into a Conflict with any Natural Animals to move their disposition from Hostile to Neutral or from Neutral to Friendly, though not from Hostile to Neutral in one Conflict. This is only temporary, however, ending a few hours after first contact.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ENDURANCE TRAINING </strong>A Wilderman is used to running and jumping for hours on end and gain a -1 to their Encumbrance for every 2 levels obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Survival Skill Suite) </strong>At first level and every level up, Wildermen receive a free purchase in the Survival Skill Suite.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A Wilderman finds no comfort in society and they often find themselves ill-at-ease in the company of others: all races are considered 2 steps down the Racial Preference table.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Though much study and natural talent, Caster Archetypes can channel the Painted World, using its power to alter reality.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Caster Archetypes rely more on clever applications of spells rather than outright doing damage and so can often subtly shift the playing field in their favor. They rely mainly on Intellect and Wisdom since they need a high Stress Threshold as it is extremely stressful to shape Weird.</p><h1>AUGUR</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">An Augur is one who watches the stars. The times and seasons are linked to the swirl of constellations overhead and the ways of magic. Those that watch them carefully can harness their power. An Augur gains bonuses based on the passage of time, making them change with the times.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d4 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Augurs receive 1 purchase of the Lore Skill Suite.

This gives them a steady pool of Spell Points whenever they cast a spell.</p><p style="margin:0px;">At first level, all spells the Augur casts have 7 SPs. This can be spent to modify the spell that they’re casting. It does take a moment to summon the astral forces, so casting a spell takes 3 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px;">They increase this by 1 SP for every other level they obtain.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LECTIO COTIDIE </strong>At the beginning of each day, the Augur reads the signs and divines which of the astral winds, and thus which Weird Tradition, is most dominant on that day. This happens in a cycle based on the days of the week.</p><p style="margin:0px;">When casting a spell from the Tradition linked to the day, the Augur receives an extra d4! SP to spend on that spell. This extra dice is increased by 1 size for every 3 levels they obtain.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you lose track of the day of the week, you’ve lost track of the stars and don’t gain the bonus for that day.</p><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Weekly Omen Boon </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Week of the Month</td><td>Category</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1st</td><td>Shape</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2nd</td><td>Range</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3rd</td><td>Origin</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4th</td><td>All</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SIGNUM SABBATI </strong>The Augur knows each week brings a new fate and with it, new boons. The Augur gains an additional bonus of 1 SP whenever casting a spell that applies to the particular Rudiment. This is increased by 1 SP for every 5 levels they’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, for instance, if this week is associated with Shape, roll on the Shape Rudiments Table found in Chapter 12: The Weird. If you roll, say Chain, all Chain spells you cast gain an additional SP.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you lose track of which week, you’ve lost track of the stars and don’t gain the bonus for that week.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>VESTIBULUM OMEN </strong>The calends are a special time, when the moon is new and the stars are able to shine; unfiltered, they empower the Augur. The Augur has a pool of 3 Honor Dice that they can use for spell casting anytime during the month. This pool is increased by 1 Honor Dice for every level they’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This pool refreshes on the first day of every month.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If you miss the first day of the month, you’ve lost track of the stars and don’t gain the bonus for that month.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LIBRO DEIBUS </strong>An Augur keeps a Book of Days where they store their spells.

Bad luck means a bad fate.

While doing so the caster must stand still and he glows with light, being illuminated by a column that reaches above them. This light is equivalent to a candle’s brightness.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">After 7 seconds, the Mage gains their Spell Points. Unlike other Archetypes of this type, however, a lot is left up to chance. The Mage rolls randomly for the Shape, Origin, and Range of the spell and d4! SP that they can spend on the Effect.</p><p style="margin:0px;">They also gain an additional d4! “free” SP that can either be spent on the Effect, or to modify what they rolled on the tables on a 1 to 1 basis.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When considering Drain, the Mage only has to worry about the Effect’s Base Drain and so, essentially, gets the other Rudiments for free. As long as he has more Spell Points than Drain, he can keep the spell cast.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, for example, a level 3 Mage finishes channelling and casts Flashbang. He rolls randomly and gets Circle, Double, and Aura, He rolls d8 and gets a 5 the Effect. He rolls his free dice and gets a 3. Since he’s casting Flashbang, he doesn’t want it to be an Aura (since he’ll be caught in it to), so he spends 2 of his free points to move it to “Near”, and then uses the final point to give him 6 SP so he can actually cast it.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Flashbang has an Interval of 5 Seconds, so he subtracts 3 from 6 when he casts the spell and then, after 5 seconds, does so again to essentially recast it. As long as you have SPs you can keep a spell active.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can also suffer weirdburn from keeping a spell up too long: if your spell’s Drain is greater than your current SP, the spell is still cast, but you and everyone within 200 ft takes 1 Stress for every point you’re over.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Going back to the above example: if you have 9 SP, and you keep the spell up for 15 seconds, you and those within 200 ft take 4 Stress ( 20 - 3 - 3 ). Should you continue to keep the spell up, you’d take an additional 3 Stress every 5 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">It is recommended that even though you don’t technically get those points until after that 7 second duration, that you roll everything ahead of time and figure out what you’re going to cast ahead of time. The GM is not obliged to stop the count for you if you haven’t been spending those 7 seconds wisely.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can stop shaping at any time, however, you take Stress equal to the amount of SP you have left - Weird is a powerful primal force and once unleashed, it is not stopped without cost. You also cannot cast or keep up a spell and Channel. This doesn’t remove those SP but the Wizard does lose 1 SP every 6 seconds.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Channelling in Armor</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Wild Magic Users (Mages and Wizards) both draw their power from the stars.

He can also bind an additional spell for every 3 levels he’s obtained. This means that he may cast those spells at any time by simply speaking the rune they’re linked to, once prepared. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Speaking the rune releases it from it’s binding so speaking the same rune again before he’s resealed it will not recast the spell - the spell’s power is gone. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> He may cast a spell multiple times per day but he’ll need to bind each instance of the spell to a different rune. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Speaking a rune in this way doesn’t affect the Runegalder and so he ignores Fallout to himself.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> He may also unseal a rune without actually casting it but he is not able to immediately reseal a new rune right after.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GRIMOIRE</strong> This is the Runegalder’s spell book and keeps the spells that he binds to runes. Unlike a normal spell book, however, the spells are scribed in meteorite ink and blood that seals their magic power in the text itself. Essentially, the Runegalder’s Grimoire does the channeling latently for him.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Grimoire starts with 8 random Rudiments, though he must have at least 1 of each, and gains an additional Rudiment every level.</p><p style="margin:0px;">At level up, he then constructs his spells out of these Rudiments. These spells can’t have a Drain greater than 7 + their level (so at 1st level, his spells can only have a Drain of 6) when it is scribed into the Grimoire. A spell’s Rudiments cannot be redistributed and changed: spells in the Grimoire are immutable.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that spells cast by the Runegalder only last their Interval unless their Effect is stacked, in which case, it either increases that Interval by a like amount or gains the Stacking bonus. This is decided when the spell is cast.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, a 2nd level Runegalder scribes a new spell. He can max out at 7 Drain. He chooses to make it a Wall Shape (3 Drain), at Full Range (1 Drain), Near Origin (1 Drain) and for its Effect, he choses Disorient (2 Drain), for a total of 7. He could have also made it Chain Shape instead for 1 Drain, and Stacked the Disorient Effect, if he wanted. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Spells inscribed at different levels count as completely different spells and must be sealed to different runes. So if the Runegalder has a 6 SP Flash Grenade and a 11 SP Flash Grenade, he would need two runes to cast both. He couldn’t simply bind “Flash Grenade” to one rune and then choose which he wanted to use in the moment.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Arcana, 1)</strong> Through the course of her career, a Runegalder seeks to further their knowledge of the occult.

He ages at twice the normal rate.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, the Runegalder's magic is 'dead' and so is less potent than other types of magic, thus allowing some to shrug off their spells.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> When shaping a spell, the Runegalder rolls a d20! + 10 + their level. All those that would be affected by the spell roll a d20! + their level. If their total is above the Runegalder's, they're unaffected by his magic. This roll is made regardless of whether or not the person wants to be affected by the spell.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to take another Caster Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double down in their Primary.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Runegalder Doubling Down Benefits</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>VANCIAN CASTING</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can seal a new spell every level.</p><h3>GRIMOIRE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your Grimoire starts at 10 Rudiments and new spells have 8 + ( level x 2 ) Drain.

As such, they don’t cast spells so much as manifest them into existence. Unlike most other casters, the Sourcerer doesn’t rely on luck or Astral Winds, but instead generates power from within. This is a slower process making Sourcerers less helpful in the moment but more powerful given a bit of time.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d8 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Sourcerers gain the Skills and Masteries of their Secondary Archetype.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MANIFEST SOURCERY </strong>Whether born under a certain constellation or through a long lost bloodline, the Sourcerer has a special connection to the Painted World. They’re a font of magic, making them very powerful and very dangerous.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Drawing from within is consistent but takes time. Every 10 seconds, you add the 10s digit of the number of SP’s in your pool into your SP pool, minimum 1. So, after 50 seconds of manifesting, you would have 15 SPs ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 ).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Sourcerers don’t suffer from normal Fallout and can continue to Manifest for as long as they want, however, this power comes with a price. Being a conduit of the unworldly saps their life and every time they add SPs to their pool, they take damage equal to that pool.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Manifesting requires light concentration so they can do other things while casting spells but if it’s something particularly difficult (like combat or doing mathematics), the Manifesting time is doubled. You can also stop Manifesting at any time but your SP pool will atrophy at the rate of 1 SP per 6 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>POWER OVERWHELMING </strong>As the Sourcerer grows, they also grow in power and can stay between two worlds longer. They reduce the amount of damage taken from manifesting by 9 + their level, though they always take at least 1 damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRADITION ATTUNED </strong>A Sourcerer is always attuned to a certain Weird Tradition and, at 1st level, knows all Effects from that Tradition and 1 random Rudiment of each type besides that. Starting at 2nd and 11th level, you can choose a second and third Tradition, respectively. At this level and at every other level you obtain, you may select an Effect from that secondary Tradition or roll for another random Rudiment.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAGON SKIN </strong>A Sourcerer is a well of Weirdcan, therefore, to some exact, absorb Weird that is thrown at them but it comes at a cost.

Speakers spend decades learning to correctly pronounce each syllable and its meaning; learning the subtleties that each inflection brings. As they grow in power, the words they speak take on more power.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Once the Speaker decides what their spell will look like (Shape, Origin, Range, and Effect) and what its Drain will be, they roll 343 (note that these dice don’t explode). If the result is higher than the Drain cost, the spell comes into being. The Speaker is free to roll less dice and/or smaller dice, if they so desire.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Speaking words of power takes actually time, specifically 2 seconds per dice rolled. </p><p style="margin:0px;">If 3 - your current Stress Penalty (minimum 1) of the dice you roll come up as 1s, the Speaker has made a major mispronunciation and the GM rolls for a random Effect from a random Tradition but with otherwise identical dimensions to the spell the Speaker wished to cast.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Since Speakers are not channelling astral power like other magic users, the Stress they gain from Fallout is 6 - their level + number of spells cast in the last 24 hours down to a minimum of 1.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DICTION TRAINING </strong>As a Speaker gains experience, she becomes more able to get around the trickier parts of the Divine syntax and so can add more force and power to her spells.

This has two major benefits:</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The first is that the Aura Origin has a Drain of 0, instead of 5.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The second is that a Warlock can instantly pull SP from the living creatures around him. This gives him 1 SP per second per person within 10 ft but deals that amount of damage to every person he is pulling from. This includes himself but he also takes an additional damage per second. This blood pull is unaffected by armor but is blocked by other living beings, if they’re closer. Essentially, if a person would give you cover from a ranged attack, they also protect you from the blood pull.

While doing so the caster must stand still and he glows with light, being illuminated by a column that reaches above them. This light is equivalent to a candle’s brightness.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">After 10 seconds, the Wizard gains d10! Spell Points (SP), which is a single pool that can be spent to shape the Weird on the fly out of any Rudiments he knows. The spell’s Drain is then subtracted from the Wizard’s Spell Point pool when he casts it and at the Interval. As long as he has more Spell Points than Drain, he can keep the spell cast.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Let’s say that you have a spell that is Shaped like a Cone (Drain 3), has a Range of Full (Drain 0), an Origin of Aura (Drain 3) and has a Base Drain of 2 from its Effect. That means the Drain of that spell is 8 ( 3 + 0 + 3 + 2 ).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If it has an Interval of 30 seconds, when you cast that spell, it costs you 8 SP and then, after 30 seconds, it costs you another 8 SP, for a total of 16.

Should you continue to keep the spell up, you’d take an additional 8 Stress every 30 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">It is recommended that even though you don’t technically get those points until after that 10 second duration, that you roll your SP ahead of time and figure out what you’re going to cast ahead of time.

You also cannot cast or keep up a spell and Channel. This doesn’t remove those SP but the Wizard does lose 1 SP every 6 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Wild Magic comes with some additional dangers, however. Should the Wizard roll more SPs than 8 + his level, he suffers a Wild Surge but untrained in it, he is unable to use it to the best of his ability.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The spell is recast, however, its Circularly Shaped at Full Range and with an Aura Origin.

Arcane Trainings are also 4 CrP cheaper for this Archetype and gains a free one every 4 levels.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Additionally, while others can only use their Arcane Training to buff up their spells, the Wizard may use the SP gained from it to lower the number of SPs they receive from channelling, thus having a chance at avoiding a disastrous Wild Surge or at least minimizing the penalty from one.</p><p style="margin:0px;">More on Arcane Training can be found in <strong>Chapter 7: Masteries</strong>.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WEIRD MEDIUM</strong> The Wizard is a bit more impersonal with his relationship with the Weird, preferring to use Weird Mediums as the fulcrum of the Weird around him. At first level, he may choose one from the following list.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Should he find himself without his Weird Medium, he’s in trouble. His threshold for Wild Surges drops to 5 regardless of level.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Weird Mediums List</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>ANCESTOR BONES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> This magic user was gifted the bones of his ancestors, powerful wizards from ages past that are able to give their descendants some of their prowess. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At 1st level, a Wizard with Ancestor Bones as his Weird Medium lowers his channelling time by 1 second. He also lowers it by an additional second for every 5 levels he’s obtained, down to a minimum of 2.</p><h3>INVESTED ITEM</h3><p style="margin:0px;">This Medium comes in many shapes and sizes. By binding her soul to an item, a Wizard can make a metal object an extension of her power.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While holding this item, she may cast any spell with Somatic components as if the hand was free. For armor, the Invested Item offsets the penalty to casting by 1 Drain for every 5 levels the Wizard has obtained. This can only offset the penalty, and never lower it below the base speed. For weapons and other items, they may also cast spells with a Touch Origin on a successful hit, storing one spell indefinitely until it’s used. Needless to say, this a much favored Medium of battle mages.</p><h3>ORB</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These are often called a Seer’s Orb, as this is favored by Wizards of the Occultism Tradition. Orbs are often glass, but those of other materials are not uncommon, though they tend to be precious metals or stones. The only requirement is that they’re larger than your fist. Orbs bend reality, gaining an automatic increase to any spell’s Range by half of its Base Range for every 3 levels of the Wizard.</p><h3>SPELL BOOK</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> A large tome, traditionally, the spell book is the favored Medium of the more scholarly magic user.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The Spell Book is not simply incantations jotted down or notes about rituals - it’s an extension of the Wizard’s brain. As long as he’s touching it, he automatically gains the ability to shape using any Rudiment in the book.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Wizards who select this Weird Medium gain 2 extra starting Rudiments, however, these are only stored in their Book. They also gain a new Rudiment every 3 levels, which is also stored there, meaning that if they lose the book, they lose those Rudiments..</p><h3>SPELL TATTOOS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Painted Men are common in the frozen tundras of Askemark. The metal heavy ink serves to store channeled magic and allows the Wizard to keep invested power for longer.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">With Spell Tattoos, the time it takes to lose a SP when not channeling is doubled for every 4 levels the Wizard has obtained. This also lowers the Stress taken from stopping a spell with SP left by 1 per every 3 levels. </p><h3>STAVE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Traditionally made of holly wood harvested with a silver sickle at midnight on the night of the new moon, Staves serve as extensions of the Wizard’s soul, much like an Invested Item, but because it’s not made of metal, it holds different properties.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While welding a Stave in one hand, the Wizard offsets the Fallout from casting a spell by 1 every 3 levels the Wizard has obtained. This can't lower it below 0, however, but does extend to the people within 50 ft of them as well.</p><h3>FAMILIAR</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Favored by the traveling Wizard, a familiar is a small animal or homunculus that is bonded to the Wizard’s soul. Because of this connection, a wizard can see and hear through their Familiar’s eyes and ears as well as channel SP through it, as long as it is standing still, allowing the Wizard full movement even when channeling.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Familiars are small sized creatures. The player selects three candidates, but the GM makes the final decision on which creature came when she called, unless the Wizard opts to have built herself a homunculus.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Wizard who would get 2 Weird Mediums but chooses familiar twice may select a medium or large sized creature or any small sized creature of her choice.</p><h3>WAND</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> The Wand is an exact tool, a tool of precision. It is favored by more aggressive spell casters because it makes their spells hard to resist. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While casting with a Wand, the Wizard gains a free Stack of one of the spell’s Effect Rudiments for every 3 levels they’ve obtained.</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SPELL LIST</strong> A Wizard gains 8 random Rudiments at 1st level and an additional Rudiment every 3rd level.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Arcana, 1)</strong> Through the course of her career, a Wizard seeks to further their knowledge of the occult. They receive 1 free purchase of the Arcana Advanced Skill at every other level up. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL ADEPT</strong> This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> The Wizard’s study can sometimes leave her with a divorced relationship to reality that can make them somewhat obtuse. When bringing in Traits, Wizards reroll their highest dice roll. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to take another Caster Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double down in their Primary.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Wizard Doubling Down Benefits</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>WILD MAGIC CASTING</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Channeling dice is increased to d20! and increases every level.

They may use any spell from the Animism, Calling, and Occultism Traditions with their Honor Dice from Favor behaving like a Channelling Dice. They have access to all other Rudiments and may spend Favor normally to modify their surroundings as well. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TONGUE OF THE DEAD</strong> Whenever an Ashcaller invokes a Miracle and any of the Honor Dice explode, the next Miracle's invocation gives them an additional free Honor Dice. This bonus doesn’t stack if multiple dice explode.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HONORING AND HONORED</strong> The Ancestors smile on those that strength their legacy. Whenever an Ashcaller gains Honor, they gain an equivalent amount of Favor. This can put them over their Max Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ETERNAL FAVOR</strong> An Ashcaller is loved for their devotion to their Ancestors beyond others. They add their level to their Max Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CATECHISM</strong> By reading the embers and smoke of their holy fires, the Ashcaller is about to discern the will of his Ancestors and better understand the Higher Realms. They receive a free purchase of the Religion (Ancestors) Advanced Skill at 1st level and at every level up.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Ashcallers have turned their back on the Divines and so are unable to invoke Miracles that are not directly related to their Covenant.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double down in this one.</p><h1>CONCERT</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Concert is a people’s person in the deepest sense. They help others be their best self, buffing others by linking their souls together.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d4 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Receive double the Skill & Masteries of your Secondary Archetype. Replace any instances of “or” with “and”</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CONDUIT OF THE SOUL </strong>The Concert is a vessel for the divine in all living things. They add their level to their Max Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SOUL UNITED </strong>The Concert, by using the links between people, is able to strengthen themselves and others.</p><p style="margin:0px;">A person is considered Soul Linked if the Concert has a Devotion that includes a person or vice versa. This can be met with a general Devotion.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If they met both conditions (both have a Devotion to each other), they’re considered Soul Fettered. This doesn’t count if both have a general Devotion to one another: at least one Devotion has to be specific to either the Concert or the other person.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ONE BEING </strong>Any Miracle is considered in her Covenant when invoked on someone the Concert is Soul Linked to.</p><p style="margin:0px;">On top of this, if it is someone they’re Soul Fettered with, she gains half the Favor (rounded down) spent this way back.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WE'RE ALL FRIENDS </strong>The Concert has a unique ability to just chill everyone out and get them to relax, even around age old enemies. If someone who she is Soul Linked with is about to be attacked by a sentient foe, before the first blow is actually thrown, the Concert can spend 5 Favor to initiate a Conflict to get both sides to back down.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If it is someone she is Soul Fettered to, she may do this for only 3 Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MUSE </strong>The Concert inspires others to rise to the challenge just solely based on her strong belief in them. When starting a Conflict, Combat, or Skill Challenge, the Concert receives 2 uses of her Honor Dice that she may give to anyone she is Soul Linked to.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If they are Soul Fettered, that person receives the max value of the dice when they redeem them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">She gains an additional Honor Die for every level she’s obtained.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px;">A Concert’s being is linked to others and so their fates are entwined. If someone who is Soul Linked to the Concert dies, they gain 20 Stress each time.</p><p style="margin:0px;">However, if someone they are Soul Fettered with dies, they gain no extra Vitality and no Vitality Die roll on level up. If more than one dies, that subtract 1 for each person from their Max Vitality.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double down in this one.</p><h1>PARAGON ACOLYTE </h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These people take hero worship to another level and by emulating their idols, they convince the already shaky reality that they’re the reincarnation of said hero, giving them amazing powers. </p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d8 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Paragon Acolyte receives a free purchase of 1 Skill Suite relating to his hero’s story.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PARAGON’S LEGACY </strong>The Paragon Acolyte can channel his hero, allowing him to recreate events from their life on a smaller scale. The player selects 5 feats that the hero performed during their lifetime and, whenever they invoke Miracles related to one or more of those feats, they increase the Honor Dice they get from Favor by 1 size. It is increased an additional size for every 4 levels the Paragon Acolyte has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LIKE STORIES OF OLD </strong>Feeling the power of the old stories rush through your veins, it allows you to soar higher than mortals dare. Whenever you roll the maximum amount on their Honor Dice, you gain another use of your Honor Die.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MANIFEST DESTINY </strong>Fate is always on the side of the hero, then and now. By spending a point of Favor, you can turn one of your Conflict, Skill Check, or Defence die to its maximum size. You can do this once at first level and an additional time every 2 levels.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MANTLE HERO </strong>At the end of each day, the Paragon Acolyte receives 1 Favor for every 10 points of Fame they have, minimum 1, but does not gain Favor by Holy Days or Sacrifices.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GREATER BEING </strong>Linked to their hero’s spirit, they can increase the amount of Favor they can get. Their Max Favor is their Honor Category + their level.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Every hero has a weakness that can lead to their downfall. During character creation, the Paragon Acolyte tells the story of the hero’s downfall. When it becomes relevant, the Paragon Acolyte cannot spend Honor or Honor Dice to help him.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double down in this one.</p><h1>PRIEST</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Priests focus on casting Miracles on other people rather than themselves, making them a good support Archetype for other classes. Their Miracles vary widely based on their patron Divine.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Priests receives 3 purchases of the Religion (The Priest’s Covenant) Advanced Skill for free</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DIVINE COVENANT</strong> During Character Creation, a Priest selects 1 Covenant and 1 Cosmic Link, representing their diety’s sphere of influence and personality, respectively.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Covenants change which Miracles the Priest has access to while Cosmic Links change the ways you gain and spend Favor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHEPHERD OF THE PEOPLE</strong>If someone else prays for a Miracle within sight of the Priest, the Priest can spend his own Favor to increase the effective cost of that Miracle. This ability doesn’t work on those Anointed into other cults. He gains half, rounded down, of the Favor spent this way back.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FAVORED OF THE DIVINES</strong> The Priest’s mission isn’t a selfish one, but it does have some benefits and they’re loved for their devotion to their Divines beyond others. They add their level to their Max Favor. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CATECHISM</strong> By studying the holy texts, the Priest is about to discern the will of the Divines and better understand the Higher Realms. They receive a free purchase of the Religion (Divines) Advanced Skill at first level and at every level up.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> A Priest has sworn themselves to a Higher Power and as a token of their Covenant, they must select a taboo; an action or thing they must never do, such as cut their hair or eat meat. This must be appropriate to the Divine and be approved by the GM before play begins.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double down in this one.</p><h1>SHAMAN</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A Shaman is one who’s invested their second soul into a Bonfire, thus they carry a part of the flame with them where they go. Because of this, others can link into their power and stand on hallowed ground where ever they go.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d8 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">They have been to the womb of creation and back, they gain one free purchase of the Lore Skill Suite.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LINKED TO THE BONFIRE </strong>The Shaman has the soul of the Bonfire and so is a generator of holy power that flows from them. They increase their Max Favor by their level.</p><p style="margin:0px;">They’re considered part of the Nature, Fire, Fate, and Honor Covenant.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MANTLE of FIRE </strong>The Shaman’s power projects out from him so that call can feel it. This is an aura of light that starts out projecting 5 ft form him and is increased by 5 ft for every 5 levels they’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;">He may temporarily increase the radius using Favor, with 1 Favor expanding it by 5 ft though this only lasts 15 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BURNING GROUND </strong>Wherever a Shaman walks is holy ground and those that have no respect for him, find themselves on shaky footing. Enemies within the Shaman’s Mantle of Fire reduce their Knock-Back Threshold by 5. This is increased by 5 for every 5 levels the Shaman has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WELCOMING HEARTH </strong>Those close to the Shaman, both physically and emotionally, find that they too are gifted with the gift of fire. Any friendly person standing with the Shaman’s Mantle of Fire also gains the benefits of any Miracle currently affecting the Shaman but only when they stand within the Mantle.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SACRIFICE of SOUL </strong>The Shaman can remove their mortal coil to manifest their true nature but doing so may kill them. For every 2 Vitality the Shaman sacrifices, they gain 1 temporary special Favor. This Favor doesn’t count towards your Current Favor and only the Cost when invoking a Miracle. All damage dealt this way goes on one Wound and the Favor is wasted if not used before the next sun rise.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The Shaman may also use this extra Favor to expand his Mantle of Fire.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WARMING SOUL </strong>The Shaman warms the souls of others like the fire warms the body. Those around the Shaman heal an additional Stress after a day of travel together. This is increased by 1 for every 2 levels the Shaman’s obtained.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px;">The Shaman literally glows with inner light, giving enemies a +10 to spot them.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double down in this one.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Additionally, when they invoke a Miracle, the Bonfire swells within them, making 10 ft around them Bright Illumination. The Shaman is penalized as well if they don’t close their eyes, though there’s no permanent damage.</p><h1>SYMBOLIST</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Symbolist is the word and the law, both being sacred to him. His worships reality itself and channels the innate power in the corpse of Ymir to shun magic and miracles. He grips the law so tightly as to bend it to his will.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d10 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Being attuned to the beat of the world, Symbolists receive one free purchase of the Survival Skill Suite.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LINKED TO THE BONES OF YMIR </strong>Harnessing the divine energies of the Middle Realm, the Symbolist is able to become a part of the world in a more real way. He gains Favor equal to his Honor Category + 1/2 his level. Unlike other Servants, he can’t gain additional Favor through the normal means (sacrifices and holy days): this Favor is static and only increases with level.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MARKS of the EARTH </strong>Through ceremony and ritual, the Symbolist is able to invoke Miracles that are normally reserved only for the Divines. Given an hour, the Symbolist can endow a mark on him or another person. During the ceremony, he selects a certain number of his Favor and “locks” into the mark.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Doing so essentially invokes a Miracle on that person, however, unlike a normal Miracle, it persists for as long as the person marked wishes it and there is a distinct chance of failure: the Symbolist must roll over 10 on their Honor Dice. He gains an additional roll of the Honor Dice for every Favor he locks in.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the Miracle is unsuccessfully invoked at the end of the ceremony, the mark, and the Miracle by extension, didn’t take and that Favor is freed once more, however, the Symbolist can’t try the ceremony again on that person until they increase an Honor Category.</p><p style="margin:0px;">If it was, that Miracle active, blessing the Symbolist and/or marked person. The mark can only be removed at the will of the person or Symbolist and can’t be removed by normal means (so washing won’t get rid of it). The Favor is “locked” and can't be used for other marks and Miracles until released. </p><p style="margin:0px;">Unlike normal, the Miracle doesn’t give the full Honor Dice as a bonus whenever the Miracle is applicable: instead the person gains a +1 (or -1 depending on what the person wants when they roll) for each Favor locked into that Miracle when applicable. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Like normal Miracles, however, this can modify things you normally couldn’t, like Movement speed or Knock-Back, or what-have-you. The GM may also increase this bonus if he feels it is appropriate (getting a +1 to your equipment breaking isn’t that big of a deal so increasing it to +3 wouldn’t be out of place, for example).</p><p style="margin:0px;">Should the Symbolist die, all his marks are released. Also, should the Symbolist’s Favor drop below their currently locked Favor (from lowering an Honor Category, for example) they’re forced to unlock one of their marks and dispel a Miracle. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LAW of AVERAGES </strong>The Symbolist is a pillar of certainty in a sea of chaos. If the Symbolist rolled under the average on a dice, he may gain 5 Stress and the next roll someone makes gives them a +1 bonus to their roll. Additionally, if he rolled over the average, he may spend 5 Stress for the next roll to be at a -1 penalty.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This bonus is also increased by 1 for every 2 levels they’ve obtained and can negate perfect attacks and defenses.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CONDUIT OF REALITY </strong>The Symbolist can invoke Miracles from the following Covenants: Dream, Guardians, Adversity, Battle, Beauty, Fate, Fire, Home, Honor. He is unable to invoke any Miracles outside of these Covenants, even for the normal price.</p><h3>PRIMARY BOON</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EXPERT </strong> Law of Averages is increased to every other level and Honor Category + 1/2 level</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CASTER </strong>Symbolists can't select a Caster Archetype as their Secondary</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SERVANT </strong>Symbolists can’t select another Servant Archetype as their Secondary. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SOCIALITE</strong> Law of Averages is increased to every other level and Honor Category + 1/2 level</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FIGHTER </strong> Law of Averages is increased to every other level and Honor Category + 1/2 level</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px;">By anchoring themselves to the Bones of Ymir, the Symbolist cuts off his connection to the God’s Realm in a way: other Servants are unable to invoke beneficial Miracles on him and they also increase their Honor Dice by 1 size when invoking destructive Miracles on him.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double down in this one. Also, due to their inheritant link with Ymir, they're unable to take a Caster Archetype as their Secondary. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Socialite Archetypes are people people. They seem to get a real kick out of interacting with other; especially if it ends with them getting their way. While other's first weapons are sword, a Socialite's first weapon is their charm. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Unsurprisingly, Socialite Archetypes tend to rely on Intellect and Charisma.</p><h1>ADVOCATE</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While other Socialites like the limelight, the Advocate doesn’t mind playing second fiddle and in fact, thrives there. When supporting others in a Social Conflict, the Advocates gets a lot of bonuses.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d4</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Advocates gain 1 free purchase of the Lore Skill Suite.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RETHINK AN ARGUMENT </strong>Advocates tend to be more introspective than other Socialites, which allows them to wait on an argument until they can articulate their thoughts more clearly. When making an Appeal, the Advocate can put aside a number of dice that they rolled a 1 on equal to 3 + their level.</p><p style="margin:0px;">They can later bring it back in, adding it to another round’s total with a +2 for every round that dice has sat out. This can bring the total over the dice's maximum value. If you win that round, you also put dice added this way into the winning pool, if applicable.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FLANKING POINT </strong>The Advocate can really use his unassuming nature to really hammer home a point. If multiple pieces of Evidence is presented in a round of a Conflict, and the opposition picks yours to respond to, you gain an additional point.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WALLFLOWER BLOOM </strong>The Advocate really shines when not center stage. When making an Appeal, if you roll the least amount of dice (or are tied for it) and your side wins the round, gain an additional point.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HELPER'S PORTION </strong>Sometimes the reward is just to know you've helped. When the person that started the Conflict is dividing out the Honor, if the Advocate takes the least amount, they gain 1 Honor + 1 for every 5 levels they've obtained.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Advocates can kind of lock up when they’re in the driver's seat. When they’re the only one in a Social Conflict, Evidence and Appeals give them 1 less point.</p><h1>ARMIGER</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Armiger is one that has been granted the right to bear a cost of arms, either their personal sigil or their liege lord. People are naturally drawn to these individuals and they find their strength in the support of this crowd.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d8 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Armigers receive 1 free purchase of the Tactics Skill Suite</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RISING THE BANNER </strong>Armigers attract the best and brightest to their banner. As such, they gain double the bonus to attracting followers from Honor. On top of this, they only gain the -5 to their roll for every other followers they attract.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FORCE OF PERSONALITY </strong>No matter the situation, Armigers are able to leverage their likeable personalities. When Rallying a broken person, they may gain another use of their Honor Die and an additional Honor Dice for every 2 levels. This additional use of the Honor Dice lasts until the end of the Conflict and doesn’t need to be spent right then.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STANDARD </strong>An Armiger has the right to bear a heraldic crest that identifies him. He may emblazon this on a banner or his shield, but by having it proudly displayed, while he is still fighting, all his allies use his Honor category to determine their starting Morale category.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Tactics, 4) </strong>At first level and every level up, Armigers receive 4 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skills from the Tactics Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Armigers are standards of the people and when they fail to live up to that, they’re judged more harshly. If the Armiger is forced to retreat from a Combat or Conflict for any reason, they lose 5 Honor.</p><h1>CHAMPION</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A crusader for a cause, paladin of the king, a knight errant questing for his love. These are Champions. Their oaths and devotions are the weapons they wield and, from sacrifice to a cause greater than themselves, strength. </p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d10 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Champions receive 1 free purchase of the Tactics Skill Suites.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Champions gain Armor Basic Training (Heavy), Shield Basic Training and 1 free Weapon Basic Training. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>POWER OF DEVOTION </strong>Zeal is a powerful force and can sharpen the mind and bring out the best in someone when properly channelled. Whenever redeeming an Honor Die while doing something related to their Devotion, they also add that Devotion to the roll.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FANATICAL PRESENCE </strong>Your oath is sacred and only death can prevent you from the fulfilment of your duty and others can see that. This total faith in your path makes the going easier for others. </p><p style="margin:0px;">During a Morale Conflict that relates to the Champion’s Devotion, whenever an argument involves him, one of those dice gets a +1. This is increased by 1 for every level you’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Multiple Devotions don’t stack in this case. You may add this bonus regardless of whether or not you're the party captain and anyone on the Champion’s side is eligible for this benefit.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SOLEMNITY OF CAUSE </strong>A Champion considers his obligations with a solemn contemplation and as his beliefs are challenged, the stronger they grow. If he rolls at least two 1s on his Repercussions from a Social Conflict where one of his Devotions was involved, he may increase the size of one of that Devotion for free in addition to his other choice of benefit.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IRON RESOLVE </strong>Nothing, not even apparent defeat, can sway a Champion from their course of action. In a Conflict that is related to at least one of their Devotions, when the Champion loses an Appeal, they gain a +1 to their next round if they Appeal again. This is increased by 1 for every 3 levels they've obtained. they </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Those on his side are also bolstered by this surety and gain the same bonus if the Champion gets it.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Champions take their oaths very seriously and don’t take new ones on lightly. When rolling Repercussions, a Champion may only choose “Gain a Devotion” if he rolled a number of 1s greater than or equal to the number of Devotion he already has. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Anytime they can purchase Devotions for CrP, the price of a new Devotion is 10 CrP x the number of Devotions the Champion already has.</p><h1>DIPLOMAT</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Diplomat is a strong willed character that makes the most of emotional Appeals: learning how to use them to great effect to sway his opponents.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Diplomats receive 1 free purchase of the Streetwise Skill Suite</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CAREFUL WORDING</strong> A Diplomat has the grace and tact to be able to reword an argument in the most effective way possible. The Diplomat can spend 10 Stress to reroll all of the dice for one side when they Appeal in a Social Conflict. For his and his allies’ Characteristics, take the higher of the two results. For the enemy, take the lower of the two results.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STRONG PERSONALITY</strong> As a Diplomat grows, she becomes more confident in who she is and what she wants. At 2nd level and every other level after that, a Diplomat can increase the strength of one of their Traits by 1 dice (up to a d20) or they save them and cash in two of these increases for a new weak Trait starting at 1d4.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GREY EMINENCE</strong> In his arena, he is king and nothing can shake him. For the duration of a Conflict the Diplomat gains 1 free use of their Honor Die. They gain an additional free Honor Die for every level they’ve obtained. They can only apply 1 of these bonus Honor Dice to a single roll, though that doesn’t stop them adding Honor Dice that they got from other sources.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RESILIENT CHARACTER</strong> Surprisingly, those with the strongest personalities have the greatest power to resist abuse and not second guess themselves. When using an Appeal, shrink the Repercussion Dice by 1 size.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Diplomats put their reputation on the table whenever they engage in Social Conflict. They lose 5 Honor whenever they lose a Conflict.</p><h1>FOIL</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Foil focuses on using the other person when convincing them of something. He can steal the opponent’s dice in Social Conflict and when things get tough, he can tag in another person to take on the Conflict.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Foils receive 1 free purchase of the Streetwise Skill Suite</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MIRRORING</strong> By agreeing with your enemy, you can sometimes lull them into a false sense of security, causing them to lower their guard. A Foil can take 15 Stress and make a guess at a Characteristic his opponent has. If he’s correct, that Characteristic loses 1 dice for every 2 levels he’s obtained, down to 1 dice. He also automatically receives points equal to the dice removed.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So a level 7 Foil who correctly guesses a 3d6! characteristic, lowers it to d6! and gains 2 points.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GASLIGHTING</strong> A Foil’s particularly devious when it comes to other’s flaws and weaknesses. A Foil can guess a character’s Mental or Behavioral Flaw. If correct, and they successfully use it in an Appeal, they gain an additional point.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CONTEMPT</strong> A Foil can pretend he doesn't care, thus shaking his opponent's confidence in their arguments. If a Foil starts the round, Appeals, and loses, they can take 10 Stress. If they do, they gain half the points they would have gotten if they has succeeded. They reduce the Stress inflicted by 1 for every 4 levels they've obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHIFT BLAME</strong> There’s strength in numbers, especially when those numbers are used as a shield. When his side makes a successful Appeal, the Foil can sacrifice 1 Honor to choose who’s dice gets added as points instead of going with the lowest. That person, however, is thrown head first into a stressful situation, suddenly becoming the center of attention, giving them 3 Stress for every point of difference between what they’re added and what would have been added. This penalty is lowered by 1 Stress for every 10 levels the Foil has obtained.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Foils are so good at mirroring others that they often forget to reflect on themselves. They only gain positive benefits from social Repercussions if they roll two natural 1s. </p><h1>FUSILIER</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Firearms are new and exciting but also dangerous. While not as damaging or as far reaching as other ranged weapons, they do terrify in a primal way, a thing that Fusiliers have learned to exploit.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d6 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Fusiliers receive 1 free purchase of the Tactics Skill Suite and 1 free Weapon Basic Training for the firearm of their choice.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STANDARD ISSUE </strong>Fusiliers often tend to gain their firearms from the military and a lot of time, they take them home (much to the chagrin of the quartermasters). They may start the game with 4 handgonnes, 10 fire lances, or a hakenbuchse.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>OF LEAD & POWDER </strong>A Fusilier trains with guns, pushing their skills to the limit, allowing to get creative in their uses. Fusiliers may wield and fire handgonnes with one hand and count as small weapons for the 2 1 Handed Weapons Style. They’re also able to deploy a hakenbuchse’s trip pod in 2 seconds instead of 5 seconds and they get 2 uses out of each fire lance.</p><p style="margin:0px;">With all firearms, a Fusilier can light the brand in a swift motion, taking no time at all, lowering the firing time by 4 seconds.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ROAR OF THE BEAST </strong>There’s something terrifying of the smell of smoke and the rage of fire and a Fusilier knows how to use this to their advantage. If in a Morale Conflict, enemies that are Appealing to those flinching gain an extra 2d6!.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Further, those that travel with the Fusilier gain an immunity to this after a combat. They may by the Born Gunner Mastery for half cost (rounded down).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">He has also grown accustomed to the roar of the cannon and so it immune to flinching from firearms.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Roar of the Beast Lite</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">If you’re not running the Morale rules, here is another option to not have the Fusilier nerfed because of this change:</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Fusilier can select a number of flinched enemies up to his Warfare Skill Rank to gain an additional -2 to their Defense for each Wound Category they've dropped.</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BOOMSTICK </strong>By adding just a little something to the powder mix, the Fusilier can make that bang from the firearm going off exceptionally loud. The minimum amount of time an enemy flinches from a Fusilier’s firearm going off increases by 1 for every 2 levels they’ve obtained. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MARTIAL TRAINING </strong>A Fusilier receives a Tier 1 Weapon Advanced Training in the Firearm of his choice for every level he’s obtained.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Due to all the gunfire a Fusilier has been around, they have a harder time hearing than others. The Listening Advanced Skill costs 6 CrP instead of 4.</p><h1>KNAVE</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Knave is a mean villain - mean in the sense of being crude and villian in the sense of being low class, but unlike others, the Knave doesn’t seem to mind and that’s where their strength lies.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d6 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Knaves receive no free skills</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>UNIMPRESSED </strong>A Knave knows that silly titles are only there to buttress insecurities. Others gain no benefit from their Fame, Honor, and/or Stat Social Dice when engaging in Social Conflict with the Knave. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PLAYING DIRTY </strong>While others hoard their precious Honor for the sake of not having people talk bad about them, the Knave doesn’t care and so she can use her as a weapon. A Knave can lose 3 Honor to increase all her Characteristic dice by 1 and reroll all non-exploded dice she’s using in her Appeal that round. She can also increase 1 extra dice by 1 size for every 2 levels she’s obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FOOL’S BEARING </strong>By deflating yourself, you can deflate others. Each round, a Knave can pay X Honor or X points to lower all non-Flaw Characteristic dice by X sizes for everyone in that round (including the Knave and her allies). This follows the normal rules if a Characteristic would drop below a d4!, however, the Knave’s never drop below 1d4!.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This ability shrinks a single dice an additional size for every 2 levels she’s obtained.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Knaves aren’t really heroes at the end of the day, even if they try to be. Shrink their Honor Dice by 1 size.</p><h1>MONTEBACK</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Monteback is one of tricks and quick thinking. He relies on dazing the person with words, hoping they won’t take the time to catch onto his tricks.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d4 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Montebacks receive 1 free purchase of the Streetwise Skill Suite</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FAST TALKER </strong>If you can get someone to agree quickly, so much the better. You start the Conflict gaining an additional d8! but shrinks one size each round, down to a d4!. You gain an additional dice for every 2 levels you've obtained. You only get this bonus if you choose to Appeal that round. The dice shrinks even if you use Evidence that round.</p><p style="margin:0px;">However, if you’re unable to convince your target by that time, the next round you receive no bonus dice from this ability and each round after, you instead reduce the size of one of your dice if you Appeal.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>JACK OF ALL TRADES </strong>You don’t have to know everything but you should act like you do. The Monteback has mastered that art and so they increase the dice they gain from their Skills by 1 size.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>KEEP 'EM OFF BALANCE </strong>The Monteback knows how to make a mark sweat and uses that pressure to have them start making rash decisions in his favor. If your opponents gain a Repercussion dice, they roll it instantly. They gain the Stress immediately though Long Term Repercussions are still held till after the Conflict.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Streetwise, 4) </strong>At first level and every level up, Montebacks receive 4 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skills from the Streetwise Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Monteback is the devil in disguise and his untrustworthy nature makes him never quite sure if you can trust him. You lower everyone’s Racial Preference towards you by 1, bottoming out at Hate.</p><h1>NOBLE</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Noble is typically aloof and hard to impress and so can convince people simply by making them unsure about their conviction, shrinking their dice in Social Conflict. </p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Nobles receive 1 free purchase of the Tactics Skill Suite</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NOBLE BEARING</strong> By reminding others of their lower station in life, you can remind them just how petty their needs are. You inflict 1 point of Stress for every Characteristic your opponent(s) brings in each round upto your level, rounded up.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RETHINK YOUR WORDS</strong> Assail the throne of a noble’s grace with caution, for you are at his will and pleasure. Whenever the Noble, or one of his allies, wins an Appeal, you may force the enemy to reroll one of their dice on their next Appeal.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ROYAL BACKGROUND</strong> Nobles form an elite class of society, giving them a strong sense of self and confidence. Their Devotion to their clan starts at a 1d10! and they gain the Trait “Noble Heritage” at 3d6! for free. This doesn't replace any of their 6 free Traits and may be increased in the normal matter.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GOOD BREEDING</strong> In victory or defeat, the Noble is gracious. At the end of a Conflict, the Noble receives 1 Honor automatically. This bonus is increased by 1 Honor for every 2 levels he’s obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;">All his allies also automatically gain 1 Honor, though this doesn’t increase as the Noble levels.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INHERITANCE</strong> This character may have had an extra leg up in life, allowing them the opportunity to start with better equipment than others. They gain a free weapon of their choice or a Courser mount and also gain 15 sc for each CrP cashed in at the end of Character Creation.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Noblity is a collective illusion and so those of royal blood, no matter how limited strive to keep that illusion in place. Nobles lose 1 Honor and gain 1 Stress whenever they're not referred to by either their proper title, "my lord", or "sir". </p><h1>OFFICER</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The cunning Officer is able to read a battlefield like a book and with a single command, swings the fulcrum of battle in her side’s favor. He is the party leader and the standard to which others flock.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d6 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Officers receive 1 free purchase of the Tactics Skill Suite.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Officers receive the Armor Basic Training (Light)</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MOMENTUM </strong>Those in leadership can often turn a small victory into a large one. Whenever the Officer wins a round, they gain a bonus d6! the next round for each successive time they’ve done so.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ESPRIT de CORPS </strong>The Officer can push others to limits they didn’t know they had in them to fight for their comrades. At first level, while the Officer is conscious, any ally that can see him gains a positive Devotion to the company starting at strength 1. This is increased by 1 for every level he’s obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BATTLEFIELD MANEUVERING </strong>Careful planning and strategic movement can help win over the day. The Officer can sacrifice an Honor Die to allow anyone on the battlefield to either switch Tactics or Shift without a penalty at that second. This can be done after a roll is made and the results given and the Officer can either sacrifice his Honor Die or one that the person who is benefiting from this ability has.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MARTIAL TRAINING </strong>An Officer receives her choice of a free Tier 2 Armor, Shield, or Weapon Advanced Training for every 2 levels she’s obtained.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Officers don’t really know how to fight alone and may take the better part of valor in a combat. When fighting alone, Officer characters gain 1 Stress everytime they put up dice in a Morale Conflict.</p><h1>PHILOSOPHER</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Philosopher reserves his strength, allowing his opponent in a Conflict to escalate for him. While others suffer strain from not meeting the argument straight on, the Philosopher uses it to his advantage.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Philosophers receive 1 free purchase of the Lore Skill Suite.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RHETORIC</strong> By knowing the fundamentals of how to form an argument, a Philosopher can stop and point out the logical fallacies in another’s argument (even if they’re not there). A Philosopher can flip a dice over one side, to a lower number. They can flip an additional dice for every level they’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, they can move a 7 on a d10 to 5, 3, 2, but not 10, or a 6 on a d12 to a 2 or 3 but not up to 8, 9, or 12.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STOIC</strong> Philosophers are trained so that petty things like emotion arguments don’t have as strong an effect on them and their opponent can tell. If a Philosopher uses Evidence against an opponent's Appeal or his opponent Appeals and he responds with Evidence, he gains 1 point.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CLOSING REMARKS</strong> Regardless of whether they want to hear it or not, the Philosopher knows how to make you listen. Whenever a Philosopher pushes, he gains 1 point.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PRACTICE DEBATE</strong> Even if you don’t get what you want, you can often get practice for next time. Whenever a Philosopher loses a Social Conflict, they gain 1 use of their Honor Die in their next Conflict. This increases by 1 use for every other level they obtain, however, they can’t use more than 1 per round.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Philosopher tries to not let things get personal: when they make an Appeal, increase their Repercussions dice by 1 size.</p><h1>RASCAL</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Rascal gains a few skills but their main strength is their cunning ability to avert danger, though any brush with death leaves him shaken. On top of this, in Social Conflict, the Rascal wins because he can leverage circumstances in his favor.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Rascals receive 1 free purchase of the Trades Skill Suite</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LUCKY </strong> The Rascal is naturally blessed with the ability to get out of trouble and use that adrenaline that comes as death comes near to dodge the grim reaper and keep running. After the results are given, the Rascal can take 2 Stress to modify his results by 1. These may be done with the following conditions:</p><ul><li>They can never be used to make you a better fighter. Stress gained this way can only be used to dodge death or escape a bad situation but never to make your character a superman. </li><li>The character must think of a situation that saves his rear end, something that happens to him that’s to his advantage. </li></ul><p style="margin:0px;">The key here is that it can’t be impossible but it can be highly improbable. The chandelier rope breaking right at that moment separating him from a blood thirsty guard, a pigeon flying across an archer’s view intercepting an arrow, etc. are all acceptable.</p><p style="margin:0px;">It can’t be the result of skill. Him deflecting the blade with his hand like a badass is right out.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Should the character be unable to think of a scenario that fits both of these criteria, he’s unable to gain Stress to save himself.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GREASE PAINT & GLITTER</strong> If there's one thing that a Rascal knows, it’s how to position themselves in the most advantageous light. In a Conflict, once per round, the Rascal increases one dice 1 size. This is increased to by 1 for every level he’s obtained. This can either be his or his allies’, it doesn’t matter.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Once he’s increased all dice in a round 1 size, he may then go back and increase them again, and so on.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Any, 2)</strong> At first level and every level other up, Rascals receive 2 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skill. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Rascal favors no weapons as they tend to get you killed: all Weapon Advanced Trainings are 2 CrP more expensive per Tier (Tier 1: 10 CrP, Tier 3: 22 CrP).</p><p style="margin:0px;"> War is a ladder by which capable people are able to climb the ranks of society. Fighter Archetypes focus on combat and battle, either by training and discipline or by out maneuvering their opponent.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Unsurprisingly, these Archetypes focus on Constitution, but how you approach combat may decide whether you favor Strength, Dexterity, or even Intellect or Wisdom. </p><h1>BARBARIAN</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">“Barbarian” is often a derogatory term used by people who consider themselves civilized but the truth is that the Barbarian is a title of honor. The Barbarian is a survivor and survives on wit, rather than raw power. </p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d10 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Barbarians receive 1 free purchase of the Survival Skill Suites.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Barbarians also gain Armor Basic Training (Light) and 3 Weapon Basic Trainings, 1 for a 2 handed weapon, a ranged weapon, and small weapon</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ADVANCED TACTICS </strong>A Barbarian is a skirmisher and doesn’t rely on formalized training methods like other fighters. As such, their greatest strength is the utilization of Tactics. At 1st level and at every 2nd level after that, a Barbarian can increase the bonus or lower the penalty for a Tactic by 1, though they can never make a penalty a bonus nor go beyond double a bonus’s original amount. So, the max you can get the Faint to is +10 to Attack and +0 to your Defense.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This doesn't remove requirements (such as moving) or special penalties (such as dealing half damaged while Feinting against people who Step Back or Retreat). </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRIBAL WEAPONRY </strong>Trained from birth with tribal weapons, the Barbarian thinks of disparate weapons all as extensions of his arm. At 1st level, the Barbarian picks a 2 handed weapon, a ranged weapon, and a small weapon. All these weapons are considered 1 group: any Mastery purchased for one of them is applied to every other weapon. They’re considered Tier 2 for price.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CONSTANT VIGILANCE </strong>Pay attention or end up as monster chow. Everyone receives a -1 to their Initiative for every 5 levels the Barbarian has obtained </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ENDURANCE TRAINING </strong>A Barbarian is used to running and jumping for hours on end and gain a -1 to their Encumbrance for every 2 levels obtained.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Barbarians haven’t benefited fully from the learning of more advanced civilizations. All Skills with Int as a relevant ability cost 2 CrP more.</p><h1>BERSERKER </h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Berserker is a child of war, often raised from an early age in the most punishing conditions to harden them. In battle they fly into a primal rage, craving through enemies like warm butter. </p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">higher of 2d12</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Berserkers receive no skills but they do receive 1 Weapon Basic Training and the Aggressive Fighter Mastery for free.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PAIN TOLERANT </strong>The Berserker has learned to simply overpower his pain sensors and keep fighting. At 1st level, he gains a - 3 bonus to his Trauma check. This increased by 1 for every 2 levels he's obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SCARIFICATION </strong>For every battle and victim, the Berserker scars himself to commemorate his victory. Over time, these scars serve as armor as his skin hardens. The Berserker gains 1 DR at first level and for every 4 levels obtained. Against a weapon, use whichever is highest (whether it’s the /D or static DR). This ability does stack with armor but the scars chaff and rub, so double any penalties gained from wearing it.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This scarification is unsettling to look upon. The Berserker also gains a 2d8 Trait “Intimidating Presence” because of them. This is separate from the Trait “Battle Scars”.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BATTLE FRENZY </strong>These warriors are able to drive themselves into a crazed frenzy, giving them almost supernatural abilities. While in a Battle Frenzy, the Berserker doubles his bonuses from Pain Tolerant and Scarification and makes them temporarily immune to penalties from Stress, though they still gain Stress from Wounds as per normal.</p><p style="margin:0px;">The DR granted from Scarification also applies to the damage dealt by Running and Sprinting, however, it is effectively halved for Sprinting.</p><p style="margin:0px;">On top of this, whenever they kill an opponent, they heal an amount of damage equal to the amount under 0 he puts them. So, a Berserker deals 10 damage to a person with 6 Vitality left, bringing the enemy to -4 and healing the Berserker 4 Vitality. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Battle Frenzy increases as the warrior nears death. When a Berserker is Hurt they gain an additional dice of damage equal to their Honor Die and when Wounded they gain another. This doesn't increase the effective dice number.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There are drawbacks to the Frenzy. The first is that the Berserker can take no defensive actions. This includes any defensive Tactics but also prevents him from actively crouching behind his shield for cover or Taking a Breather and, when doing aggressive actions, they are less careful, doubling their penalties from the same. Additionally, there is a price to pay for driving your body for so long; when you drop out of the Frenzy, you take enough damage, on one Wound, to drop you another Vitality Category. You also gain no benefits from Taking a Breather after doing so until you drop another Vitality Category (so you can't just heal it back up, sorry). </p><p style="margin:0px;">This Frenzy is awoken by the Berserker and takes 3d6 seconds to get into, during which time the Berserker beats his chest, screams at the sky, and just generally psyches himself up. The more wounded the Berserker becomes, however, the easier it is to get into the right frame of mind, so remove a d6 for every Vitality Category he has dropped. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHARED FRENZY </strong>Some of the manic power the Berserker commands overflows and invigorates his allies. Those on the Berserker’s side can Run for an additional 3 seconds per Berserker level and can Sprint an additional 1 second per Berserker level.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Berserkers are killers and can sometimes get lost in the glory of battle. After downing every foe on the battlefield, they need to make a Wisdom check. On a failure, they’re unable to calm down and attack the nearest person, friendly or not. After every attack they make, they can make another Wis check to try and snap out of it. Failure indicates they keep attacking.</p><h1>BRAWLER</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">On the streets or in the arena, you’ll find the Brawler, battling it out. For the joy of throwing their opponents around like a rag doll, they fight. Brawlers are unarmed fighters primarily, eager to toss anyone that opposes them aside.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d12 </p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Brawlers receive 1 free purchase of the Streetwise Skill Suite.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>REGISTERED WEAPONS </strong>The Brawler knows how to appear like a threat, even when unarmed. They always count as having a weapon for Weapon Style.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IMPROVED ADVANCED TRAINING </strong>Brawlers train to be deadly artists with their fists and soon gain a knack for it. For Brawlers, Tier 1 Unarmed Advanced Training has a Base Cost of 5.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MARTIAL TRAINING </strong>A Brawler receives a free Weapon Advanced Training for Unarmed Combat for every level he’s obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>OPPORTUNISTIC FIGHTER </strong>Part of being a streetfighter is seizing every chance you get to get ahead. A Brawler and his allies score a Near Perfect Attack and Defense on a roll of 18 and 19.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IMMOVABLE </strong>By planting yourself and watching your structure, you can really push people around. You gain an effective + 1 to your Vitality Size Modifier for Knock Backs. On top of this, you lower your enemy's Vitality Size Modifier by 1 for Knock Backs as well. This bonus increased by 1 every level.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Something about being a Brawler makes them shun weapons where they can’t get up and personal with their opponent. Ranged Weapon Advanced Trainings cost 2 CrP more.</p><h1>CATERAN</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Cateran is all about flanking your opponent and keeping other fighters locked down. As such, they work best with other fighters.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d8</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Caterans receives the Deadly Flanker Mastery, as well as free Light Armor Basic Training and 1 Weapon Basic Training.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BABY-SITTING</strong> While an individual Cateran may vary in his ability to take care of infants, they all share the ability to keep combatants locked down.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Whenever a person engaged with the Cateran tries to disengage, the Cateran gets an immediate free attack that, if it hits, deals half damage. This happens regardless of where they are on the Clock and doesn’t effect when their next attack happens. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CLOSED OPENINGS</strong> Flanking is the art of dividing people’s attention and the Cateran has perfected that art. Anyone flanked by a Cateran lowers their attack die by 1 size, regardless of who they’re attacking.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MUTIEREN</strong> A Cateran knows to move their blade to get into places their opponents wouldn't expect. If facing an enemy who's weapon has a base Parry or who is carrying a shield, the Cateran recieves a +1 to Attack +1 for every 2 levels they've obtained. This ability isn't effective against people who gained their Parry solely through training.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHADOWING</strong> By keeping close to their opponent, the Cateran can negate people’s defensive posturing. By taking 15 Stress, a Cateran can negate any bonuses an opponent gets from moving, whether that’s shifting, stepping back, or whatever and also stops their opponent from moving. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> The Cateran can do this as many times as they want but the Stress cost doubles each time they do so, though this resets once they’ve had time to destress. Also, this Stress cost is lowered by 1 for every 2 levels they’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BUM RUSH</strong> A Cateran can also use his allies to more effectively flank their opponents. The Cateran can give any other allies flanking the same enemy the benefits of the Deadly Flank Mastery if they don’t have it.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Cateran is a group fighter and fighting alone can be unnerving for him. When engaged with enemies alone and not flanking, the Cateran is unable to use his Honor.</p><h1>MAN-AT-ARMS</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Man-at-Arms uses his own know-how against his opponents. She gets more deadly the more Masteries she gains. With this she can adapt to who she is fighting where others can’t.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d10</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Man-at-Arms receive 1 free purchase of the Athletics Skill Suite. They also receive 3 free Weapon Basic Training Masteries.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>KNOW YOUR ENEMY</strong> A Man-at-Arms is good at using watching her foe and exploiting weaknesses. For every 20 seconds she is either Threatening someone or someone is Threatening her, she gains a cumulative bonus to Attack, Defense, Recovery, or Damage. This bonus, and what she can choose to apply it to is based on her Advanced Weapon Basic Training.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Tier 4 gives her a +1, Tier 3 gives her a +2, and Tier 2 and under give her a +3. She can only apply this bonus to a metric she has an Advanced Training Bonus in. So, for example, if she is fighting someone with a slashing sword and she has a +1 to Attack and Defense with all Slashing weapons (Tier 3), that means, for every 20 seconds she is fighting that person, she can add an additional +2 to her Attack or Defense. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> This bonus is applied to one metric per person and everything reset should that foe become completely unengaged wit her. So, if the Man-At-Arms is Threatening two foes for 20 seconds, she can apply her bonus to attacking one, while the other bonus goes to defending against another. If one she is defending against leaves, she has to continue applying her bonus to attacking the other. Should that foe threaten her again, she gains no bonuses again him but can change to attacking him as well. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> The time it takes to accure this bonus is lowered 1 second for level the Men-at-Arms obtains, down to a minimum 1 second. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COUNTING COUP</strong> Part of being a Man-at-Arms is keeping a reputation for your skill in combat and this can often become a game that everyone gets caught up in. If you give yourself a penalty to Attack, you gain 1 Honor and gain Relaxation equal to that penalty if you score a hit. If you've already used this ability once this Combat, your allies may do so as well, gaining an additional point of Relaxation (but not Honor) for each teammate who's successfully couted coup before them.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MARTIAL TRAINING </strong>A Man-at-Arms receives his choice of a free Tier 3 or 4 Armor, Shield, or Weapon Advanced Training for every levels he's obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IMPROVED ADVANCED TRAINING</strong> A Man-at-Arms studies the greatest weapon, armor, and shield techniques to pick them up easier. For them, Tier 2 Weapon, Shield, Armor Advanced Training has a Base Cost of 7, Tier 3 has a Base Cost of 8, and Tier 4 a Base Cost of 10.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Men-at-Arms fight and when they lose, it’s hard on them: they lose 5 Honor for every combat they’re knocked unconscious or fail a Trauma check in due to humiliation.</p><h1>KNIGHT</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Knight focuses on shield and armor, and with their larger Vitality Die, they tend to be pretty tanky. Additionally, their Inheritance allows them to get the more expense weapons for free.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d12</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Knights receive 1 free purchase of the Tactics Skill Suite.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Knights receive the Armor Basic Training (Heavy), Shield Basic Training, and 1 Weapon Basic Training Mastery for free. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IMPROVED ADVANCED TRAINING</strong> A Knight is a master of armor and defense, spending years conditioning himself to be able to wear armor and use a shield without breaking a sweat. For Knights Tier 2 Armor and Shield Advanced Training has a Base Cost of 8, Tier 3 has a Base Cost of 10 and Tier 4 a Base Cost of 14.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CHIVALRY</strong> From their strict code comes a strength and confidence that others can only dream of and envy. For the duration of a combat you gain 1 free use of your Honor Die. You gain an additional free Honor Die for every level you obtain. You can only apply 1 of these bonus Honor Die to a single roll, though that doesn’t stop you adding Honor Dice that you’ve gotten from other sources.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CALL to VALOR</strong> A Knight is a hero and inspires others to rise above. For the duration of a combat all allies gain 1 free use of an Honor Die to share between them. They gain an additional free Honor Die for every 4 levels you’ve obtained. They can only apply 1 of these bonus Honor Dice to a single roll, though that doesn’t stop them adding Honor Dice that they got from other sources, and the Honor Dice is the size of the person’s Honor Dice that redeems it.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INHERITANCE</strong> This character may have had an extra leg up in life, allowing them the opportunity to start with better equipment than others. They gain a free weapon of their choice or a Courser mount and also gain 15 sc for each CrP cashed in at the end of Character Creation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MARTIAL TRAINING</strong> A Knight receives a free Tier 3 Armor or Shield Advanced Training for every levels she’s obtained. </p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Knight is a creature of Honor and respects Honor where they find it. They may be killers but they have a code, whether articulated or not. A Knight may never use a long ranged weapon on a foe that has greater than Average Honor.</p><h1>SKIRMISHER</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Skirmishers never stay in one place longer than they have to and so are rewarded for constantly being on the move. They’re also adept at making the most of their enemies disorientation, either from surprise or from the chaos they cause.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Skirmishers gain the Attack on the Run mastery for free as well as 1 Basic Weapon Training for free. They also gain 1 purchase of the Athletics Skill Suite and 4 free purchases in the Endurance Advanced Skill</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DIRE AMBUSH</strong> Catching an enemy off guard can spread confusion and disorientation that can limit an enemy’s ability to respond. Whenever the Skirmisher hits a surprised enemy, that enemy receives -2 to Attack and Defense for the next 7 seconds. Additionally, should they move above a Walk during this time, they gain an additional -2 for each Movement Category above such for that duration. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COMBAT READY</strong> A Skirmisher is ready to go at any time. They lower their Initiative Dice down by 1 size per level they’ve obtained, down to a d2. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GUERILLA FIGHTING</strong> Skirmishers are masters at getting in, doing some damage, and getting out, causing confusion as they move. </p><p style="margin:0px;">If someone attacks the Skirmisher while she is at a Jog or higher, or misses an attack when she disengages with someone, the enemy is left open for two seconds. If hit within that window, then the enemy receives a -3 to Attack for 7 seconds + 1 every level.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RAID TACTICS</strong> Confusion allows those to dart in and out, dealing terrible damage. While receiving penalties from the Skirmisher, enemies are unable to capitalize and get no free attacks when someone disengaged with them.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Skirmisher moves and so quickly loses her edge when pinned down. She receives a -2 for every 5 seconds she hasn’t moved at least 5 ft in combat.</p><h1>SOLDIER</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Bonfire character are not meant to stand alone and this goes double for the Soldier, who work the best with others. They’re able to shadow others around the battlefield and really focus on being good at one or two weapons.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d8</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Soldiers receive 1 free purchase of the Tactics Skill Suite.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Soldiers receive either the Armor Basic Training (Light) and Shield Basic Training or Armor Training (Medium). On top of this, they gain 1 Weapon Basic Training Mastery for free as well.</p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SMALL UNIT TACTICS</strong> Soldiers work as a team. If they or anyone they’re adjacent uses a tactic that moves them (Shift, Step Back, etc.), the Soldier or their adjacent ally may also use that Tactic with no penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IMPROVED ADVANCED TRAINING</strong> Soldiers rely on others to make up for their weaknesses, as such, that gives them greater freedom to really specialize in what they’re good at. For Soldiers Tier 1 Weapon Advanced Training have a Base Cost of 6.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BUDDY SYSTEM</strong> Soldiers fight as a unit, moving and acting as one where possible. When an adjacent ally switches Tactics, the Soldier may immediately switch to that Tactic as well. On top of this, they also receive a -1 bonus to their Trauma checks, which increased by 1 for every level the soldier has obtained</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MARTIAL TRAINING</strong> A Soldier receives a free Tier 1 Weapon Advanced Training for every level he’s obtained. </p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Soldier focuses so much time drilling with his preferred weapon that he can often forget that principles with one weapon can apply to another. All Tier 4 and above Weapon Advanced Trainings are 2 CrP more expensive. </p><h1>TACTICIAN</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Tactician is a jack of all trades but master of none, focusing on being slightly less skilled at a multitude of weapons. This means that the Tactician will probably have the right weapon for the right enemy. On top of this, the Tactician is skilled at the use of Combat Tactics (hence the name) which allows them to seize opening that others can’t. Overall, the Tactician focuses on versatility.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d8</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Tacticians receive 1 free purchase of the Tactics Skill Suite.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Tacticians receive the Armor Basic Training (Medium) Mastery and 2 Weapon Basic Trainings for free. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>QUICK OR DEAD</strong> A Tactician lives on his wits. While others rely on training, he works on instinct and so can often take advantage of situations that others can’t. By taking 15 Stress, this ability allows the Tactician to change his Combat Tactic or Weapon Style, regardless of where he is on the Clock or whether or not the dice have been rolled. He must qualify for the Tactic to use it (so he can’t suddenly Charge if he’s not already at a Run). You can use this ability multiple times, however its Stress price doubles each time you do it between periods of Relaxation, but the Stress it inflicts is lowered by 1 for every 2 levels you’ve obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SECOND WIND</strong> Find the perfect time rest is what the Tactician is all about; he gains 1 additional Vitality for every level he's obtained when he Takes a Breather.</p><p style="margin:0px;">He also knows how to properly cover people when they’re trying to rest. If he is within his Measure + 5 ft of an ally, they gain 1 additional Vitality for every 2 levels he’s obtained when Taking a Breather.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Tactics, 4)</strong> At first level and every level up, Tacticians receive 4 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skill from the Tactics Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL ADEPT</strong> This character has a knack for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Tactician focuses so much on being versatile that their specific specialization suffers. All Tier 1 Weapon Advanced Trainings costs 4 CrP more.</p><h1>THUG</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Thug is designed to hit hard and make each strike count. As such they have abilities that remove an enemy’s damage reduction and increase the chance to knock someone out.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Thugs receive 2 free purchase of the Streetwise Skill Suite.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thugs receive the Armor Basic Training (Light) Mastery and 1 Weapon Basic Training for free. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CRITICAL STRIKE</strong> If you deal enough damage to move your opponent into the next Wound Category, you trigger a Trauma check with the target rolling a d12!, instead of a d20.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RUN 'EM RAGGED</strong> At the beginning of combat, the Thug gains a pool of Stress equal to 10 times his level. On a successfully hit, he may substract an amount of Stress from that pool. If he does so, he inflicts that much Stress on his target, which is healed when the person Takes a Breather.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PRECISION ATTACK</strong> The Thug is an expert at making every attack count, he lowers the DR of his opponent by 1 per 2 levels. For /d DR, this is subtracted from the final total. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Example, a level 12 Thug with a dagger (3 dice) vs Scale (2/D), would reduce the enemy’s DR to 4 (6 total DR - 2 from Precision Attack), while one using a club (1 dice) would reduce it to 0 (2 total DR - 2 from Precision Attack). </p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Thug never really rises above his street rat origins: the Leadership, Administration, Rally, and Recruiting Advanced Skills all cost double. </p><h1>VANGUARD</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Vanguard is the first in the fray, usually engaging multiple enemies at the same time and trying to do as much damage as possible to soften them up for their allies to follow.</p><h3>VITALITY DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d10</p><h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Vanguards receive 1 free purchase of the Tactics Skill Suite.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also receive the Armor Basic Training (Medium) Training and 1 Weapon Basic Training for free. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AGAINST THEM ALL</strong> When they’re in the thick of it is when the Vanguard thrives. The Vanguard gains their Honor Dice to their Attack rolls against 1 opponent when engaged with 2 or more enemies.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IN & OUT & AROUND</strong> Knowing how to slip and out of your opponent’s guards allow the Vanguard to get in and out of a jam quickly.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> By gaining 15 Stress, the Vanguard may change their engagement zone with one opponent, without any associated penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, if they’re Threatening their opponent, they could move to Engaged or they could move themselves out to Not Engaged without giving their enemy that free attack.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, if their enemy has successfully employed the In Their Guard Tactic, the Vanguard can move them back out to simply Engaged.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> They can do this multiple times by doubling the Stress gain each time it’s used. This resets after they’ve been able to gain destress. This penalty is also reduced by 1 for every 2 levels the Vanguard has obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CROWD CONTROL</strong> Surrounded by enemies, the Vanguard learns to use the crowd against themselves, forcing his enemies to get in each other’s way.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A Vanguard can use his full defense against an additional opponent if the two opponents are adjacent to each other and, should anyone try to disengage with him, he may take 5 Stress, in which case, he gains a free attack against them although this is at half damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FIRST STRIKE</strong> The Vanguard hits hard and hits first. Or at least, they try to.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> At the beginning of combat, Vanguards receive a pool of Measure equal to 1 ft + 1 per every level they’ve obtained. When they first become Engaged with an opponent, they may spend ft from that pool to temporarily increase their Measure to determine who strikes first.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, a level 6 Vanguard would have a pool of 4 ft to work with. If wielding a Stiletto (Measure 1.5 ft) and closing in to Engage with an enemy wielding a Rapier (Measure 4 ft), he could spend 3 ft of it to allow him to get his hit off first, perhaps crippling his enemy before they have change to respond. Doing so would leave him with 1 ft in his pool for the rest of combat.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After that, combat resumes as normal, so he wouldn’t be able to attack the Rapier wielder if he is being Fended Off.</p><h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Vanguards are a position of Honor and they don’t take charging into battle lightly. A Vanguard loses 1 Honor for every battle they’re not the first on either side to land a melee attack.</p><h5>Flaws</h5><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Every person have flaws; little quirks of their personality or odd behaviors. These flaws are often a way of dealing with troubles in their life, letting off Stress or rationalizing their behavior to others. Other times they’re artifacts of a hard life, like a soldier who’s missing an arm. </p><h1>BENEFITS & PENALTIES</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Flaws in Bonfire are a trade off: they’ll make your character less able to do things in certain arenas or harder to be around but allow you to invest in abilities and powers elsewhere. This is represented by the CrP bonus that you get from taking Flaws</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Another bonus is that by overcoming a character's Flaws, a person gains confidence and Honor. Essentially, this means by applying your Flaws to your detriment, your character becomes stronger. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is done very simply by saying that you think a Flaw would make something harder for your character in this situation and then giving yourself a -d4! to your Skill, Attack, or Defense roll or giving your opponent d4! Leverage. Regardless of whether or not you succeed, they gain Honor equal to your penalty. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The GM may award more Honor or inflict you with a larger penalty as seems appropriate for the situation. After all, if it's something your character really struggles with and it gives them a -d8!, it makes sense that they would get an equivalent amount of Honor for overcoming the challenge. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, note that if you're the one to bring up your Flaws, you get Honor regardless but if the GM has to do so, you only get Honor if you succeed so it is always better to bring them up yourself (unless you have a very inattentive GM). </p><h1>GAINING FLAWS</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are two ways to select Flaws: Rolling and Cherry Picking. Rolling gives you more CrP per Flaw but Cherry Picking gives you more control. </p><h3>ROLLING FLAWS</h3><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Flaw Table Table </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll (d100)</td><td>Table</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1 - 25</td><td>Background</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>26 - 50</td><td>Behavioral</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>51 - 75</td><td>Mental</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>76 - 100</td><td>Physical</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"> Roll on the first table below and then roll on the corresponding table.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You can spend 1 CrP to reroll at any time but once you’ve committed to a table, you have to roll on that table.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Each Flaw after the first loses 5 CrP of it’s value per previous Flaw to a minimum of 0 CrP received. So, the 3rd Flaw you roll will be at a -10 CrP.</p><table style="width:300px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="3" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Background Flaws </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>d100!</td><td>Name</td><td>CrP</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1 -

So, the 3rd Flaw you pick will be at a -30 CrP.</p><h1>FLAW DESCRIPTIONS</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While most Flaws can be reasonably looked up, some might need some clarification which is why they're listed below or additional penalties. We've also provided some handy tables you might find useful for figuring out the details of that Flaw. </p><h3>ADDICT</h3><table style="width:150px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Addiction </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll D20</td><td>Name</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1 - 5</td><td>Drugs</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6 - 10</td><td>Sex</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>11 - 15</td><td>Gambling</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>16 - 20</td><td>Alcohol</td></tr></table><h3>ATHEIST</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The way of the divine is a mysterious path and someone mistake it for no path at all. Some refuse to believe that intelligent higher powers exist and so forfeit some of the blessings while others find worshipping such beings laughable, like giving reverence to the biggest bully on the block.</p><h3>BLIND, TOTAL</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> This character has completely lost his sight. He sees only pure white or pure black, unable to sense any movement around him.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> In melee combat, they defend and attack with a 1d6! And ranged combat is right out, however, if you insist, you’ll be attacking with a 1d4, so enjoy your fumbles, you stubborn bastard.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Additionally, any Skill Challenges involving sight halves the person’s Skill Rank.</p><h3>BOAR FACED</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is the polite way of say that someone is ugly as sin. This could be the result of parentage or a bad accident, either way, people don’t like being around them or dealing with them. As mean as it might be, people judge books by their covers.</p><h3>DARK SECRET</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There’s something that this character is hiding and she’s worried that she’ll be found out. She’ll jealously guard every aspect of her life if she can for fear of being found out.</p><h3>DEBTOR</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has gotten into trouble financially. This character starts with 5d20 + 150 sc of debt instead of gaining a like amount to start off with. All their equipment much then be purchased on a credit of 50 sc that is also taken out of their debt. If they don’t make payments on it, they may find themselves on the bad end of the law or the loan shark they borrowed from.</p><h3>DERANGED</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> There’s holes in this character’s brains and he’s starting to slip into madness. The nature of this neurosis is up to the character.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The character doesn’t suffer the effects of Stress until it matches his Wisdom score, at that point, he has an episode and doubles his total Stress. Once, he’s recovered (dropped his Stress back down below his Wisdom), he suffers a permanent reduction 1 to both his Intellect and Wisdom.</p><h3>EPILEPTIC</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Something is not wired up just right in this character’s brain and that causes them to have little short outs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When something triggers a Trauma check for the character, or their Stress reaches above their Int score, there is a 1 in 8 chance of the character having a seizure, in which they’re completely helpless for the next 1d3 minutes.</p><h3>EXCOMMUNICATED</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> This character has invoked the wrath of an angry god, calling down divide judgement on his head. This is more commonly a member of the faithful who’s fallen away or lost his way or willfully defies the cult’s teaches, but less commonly, it’s an outsider who’s been declared an enemy of the faith. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Excommunicated members cannot gain the blessings of any miracles related to a single Covenant. Additionally, baleful invocations from priests of the deity that excommunicated them half their threshold.</p><h3>FATED</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Certain character’s bear a strange sign on them that marks them for doom. The cruel strings of fate weave together to form a noose for them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At creation, the GM rolls 1d8!. This is the number of sessions the character has before Fate begins to sharpen her shears. After that point, the character takes extra damage each time they're hit equal to how many sessions have passed since then.</p><h3>FERAL</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> The wild and untamed lands are home to frontier men and families. Occasionally, children escape and are raised only by the wild, occasionally wolves.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Feral characters still receive any free skills from their class but any additional skills they try to pick up can only be from the Survival Skill Suite.</p><h3>HALF LIFE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has died and forced back to life, maybe against his will. This character is affected by the Force Bind Spirit spell, though the Duration is set to 1d4! - 2 (minimum 1) years and a day. Why he came back is up to you. Perhaps he had some unfinished business or perhaps he was targeted accidently. In any case, now he lives a half life.</p><h3>HAUNTED</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Mostly commonly, this character has done something to dishonor his clan and has been since been haunted by one of their ancestors, displeased by their actions.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The spirit takes the corporeal form of a rotting corpse wearing it’s death mask, bothering the possessed at all hours to restore his family’s honor and stop being such a failure. The ancestor will do nothing to protect their descendant and often make life harder for them when they can. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Unfortunately, decades, if not centuries, in the grave have made the ancestor more than a bit senile. Even if the character is to obtain Great Honor, the ancestor doesn’t care; what it really wants is for the character to sacrifice themselves in a heroic way or perform suicide.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This character doesn’t heal Stress naturally and loses 1 Honor at the end of every session.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Flaw may be paid off for half cost if the character has lasted 2 sessions in Great Honor, however it goes back up to full price if they slip out of Great Honor later.</p><h3>HEMOPHILIC</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These guys love to bleed. Well, they may not love it but they certainly do it a lot more than the rest of us. They take an additional d4 points of damage every time they're wounded. </p><h3>IDIOT SAVANT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character was born gifted. Or in other words, they were born with the ability to understand something but nothing else. This character picks an Advanced Skill or Mastery; all other Skills and Masteries cost double. The chosen Skill or Mastery now costs half.</p><h3>IMPISH</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character loves getting into trouble, mostly through pranks of all kinds. While she’s not inherently malicious, her pranks tend to be unwelcome.</p><h3>IMPOTENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If this character was a tree, he’d have particularly softwood, if you know what I mean. His lack of confidence in his abilities in the bedroom, tend to affect the other parts of his life, often snowballing; he loses an additional Honor for every 10 lost.</p><h3>INBRED</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Often a curse of the nobility that get too close to their cousins, inbreeding can stunt the mental capacity of their offspring. Typically, this is pretty mild for the most part, but it means that increasing this character’s Intellect score costs double and they half any points they add to it when they level up.</p><h3>LIMP</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Something isn’t working just right, whether from a birth defect or a war wound, causing this character to hobble along at a slower pace. Characters with a limp move at half their speed at all times.</p><h3>MISSING ARM</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Most likely this is the result of some terrible accident or horrific war wound, though some people are born with an arm missing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character with this Flaw is unable to wield two handed weapons, employ bows or crossbows, or anything else that needs two hands.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Flaw may be rolled multiple times, with the second time you take this flaw making it worth 60 CrP, as it prevents the character from using any weapons, and makes them unable to cast spells with Somatic components</p><h3>MISSING EAR</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> While it won’t limit your ability to hear entirely, the shape of the ear does make it easier to hear things.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The first time you roll this Flaw, all Listening Checks take a penalty of -3.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The second time, all Listening checks are 3 Difficulties harder and your initiative dice becomes one worse. You gain 25 CrPs instead of 20 (in addition to the CrPs from the first time you picked this Flaw up). </p><h3>MISSING EYE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> You can imagine that a character with one eye gone would have an issue with his depth perception. You’d be correct.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The first time a character gains this Flaw, he automatically attacks second when engaging in melee, even if his weapon has the greater reach and everything is counted as two range categories further for ranged weaponry.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The second time this Flaw is rolled, the penalties are replaced by those of the Blind, Total Flaw and he gains an additional 25 CrP.</p><h3>MONOTHEIST</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> For this character, there is only one true god and all other divines are false deities or the work of devils.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> He will refuse help from pagan clerics and is bound to only miracles within his chosen Covenant. </p><h3>MULE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While they may not show it, this character is the result of mixed ancestry and something about their unnatural genesis makes them sterile, unable to promulgate. While this will definitely make creating a dynasty an issue, certain carousers may hardly consider this a Flaw.</p><h3>NO DEPTH PERCEPTION</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has a hard time reading distances making it so that he automatically attacks second when engaging in melee combat, even if his weapon has the greater reach and everything is counted as two range categories further for ranged weaponry.</p><h3>OPUSPHOBIA</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Opusphobia is defined by a fear or repulsion of a certain career choice. Someone with this Flaw may dislike horse merchants because he sees them all at crooks or innkeepers because he’s afraid they’re working with the Thieves Guilds.</p><h3>PASSIONLESS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Whether because of imbalance in their brain or they haven’t really found that thing that calls to them, a Passionless character has problems really being interested in any given subject they try to engage in. Passions for them cost double to purchase and increase and any situation die they gain from their Skills are always one smaller.</p><h3>POOR</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some characters don’t have the financial leg up that others have. These characters must choose the following Equipment Kit during Step 11 of Character Creation. </p><table style="width:350px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="3" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Pauper's Kit </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Item</td><td>Size</td><td>Sellback</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1 S weapon</td><td>S</td><td>15</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Breeches, Good Linen, Light, Fine*</td><td>n/a</td><td>12</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Shirt, Wool, Fine*</td><td>n/a</td><td>13</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Sandals, Leather, Natural Color*</td><td>n/a</td><td>4</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Rations, Person, Day x 3</td><td>3S</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td colspan="2">Weight: 1M 1S</td><td>Extra Cash: 1d10! cc</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"></table><h3>PHOBIC</h3><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Phobias </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Roll D10</td><td>Type</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Animals</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>Being Restrained</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td>Combat</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td>Commitment</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5</td><td>Conflict</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6</td><td>Magic</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>7</td><td>Relgion</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>8</td><td>Sickness</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>9</td><td>The Dead</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>10</td><td>The Opposite Gender</td></tr></table><h3>REFUGEE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Fleeing from their homeland for either economic, religious, or conflict reasons, this character finds themselves in a foreign land. Their flight has forced them to leave much of their belongings behind, halving their starting cash and they tend to be unfamiliar with the language and customs. Their native language is not the main one for this area and the Language and Law of the country they’re fleeing to costs double as they had to learn it under stressful circumstances</p><h3>SECRET IDENTITY</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> For whatever reason, whether they’re hiding from enemies or they want to put their old life behind them, this character is trying to keep their past a secret. When this flaw is rolls, this character selects one of their Archetypes to be the remnant of their past. Any mention of the Archetypes abilities nets this character 1 Stress.</p><h3>SELF MARTYR</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Life doesn’t feel complete if people don’t know how much you’re sacrificing for them.</p><h3>SENSITIVE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has superb senses compared to others, however it makes it challenging for them to function sometimes as they can just get overloaded.</p><h3>SENSITIVE HEARING</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character is incredibly prone to noise. Other’s normal talking voice sound to them like they’re yelling. You’ll think this would help them suss out noise more effectively but instead it makes it harder to hear because there’s too much sensory input.</p><h3>TALKER</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Whether around the campfire or in stressful situation, this person can’t keep their mouth shut. They’ll just talk and talk, only stopping to take necessary breathes.</p><h3>THRALL</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thralls are those taken in raids or the children of slaves. Technically, they’re ‘free’ but they have a social stigma that follow them. Thralls gain no extra starting cash and half the amount of equipment the kit normally starts with and as never gain Advantage with a tie in a Social Conflict. </p><h3>VOW of POVERTY</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Middle Realm corrupts and those that wish to come closer to the Gods’ Realm sometimes eschew worldly possessions. This character only keeps enough wealth on them to buy basic food to sustain them for that day, all other wealth is donated to any local cults. They give their goods to the needy, not fellow adventurers. Their Max Favor is increased by 1. </p><h5>Character Vitals</h5><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The purpose of this chapter is to condense all the rules for calculating things about your character so that it can keep the other chapters to just rules you’ll need at the spur of the moment during gameplay. To this end, these rules are missing why they’re important and what you’ll actually use them for but they do reference the chapter where more is to be found. </p><h1>STRESS</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Working under pressure can get to you. When your crew mates are relying on you to pull out a win, it can mess with your head. Your character can become stressed under these circumstances and stress can later manifest in odd behaviors.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Characters can gain Stress in two ways in a lot of ways and those are discussed in their various sections - taking damage, making Skill Checks, etc. - the only one we’ll go over here is Stress can be gained (and healed) from acting out your character’s social Characteristics, especially when not playing them would be a huge benefit.</p><h3>STRESS PENALTIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Stress affects almost everything you do, making your life harder and your character becomes emotionally pent up.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Every 10 points of Stress gives you a penalty of 1 to Defense, Skill Check difficulties, Running and Sprinting time.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Stress affects Morale, lowering the character's Morale Threshold Category by 1 per non-Wound inflicted 10 Stress.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Honor Through Accountability </h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> In the heat of the moment, it’s hard to keep track of all the bonuses and penalties that apply to situations, especially the penalties and especially Stress penalties, which change during the fight.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Because of this, it isn’t required that you apply Stress penalties. However, if you do, you gain 1 Honor and the other side also applies their Stress penalty without that extra Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If the GM reminds you that you need to apply your Stress, you don’t get anything but the penalty.</p></td></tr></table><h3>HEALING STRESS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Stress heals slowly over time but there are things you can do to speed it up. You have to actively go out and do things that relax your character. There are several things you can do. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The first is to give into his nature. By role playing his Flaws in a detrimental way, a character can relieve 1 or more Stress (GM’s option). This means that when a character sees a situtation where his Stress could give him a disadvantage, he can bring it up the GM. If approved, the character heals Stress. The GM may also suggest this option as well if she things the situation warrents it.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The second way is through hobbies. Hobbies are based off your character's Social Characteristics, but besides that, they can be anything, from whoring it up to spending time with the family or working in their shop. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You gain 1 point of Relaxation for each hour spent on a hobby, though you can only spend up to the number of dice that Characteristic has in hours per day. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Finally, you can indulge in creature comforts. This can be done by by buying a nice bedroll or even hiring someone to set up your camp for you so you can relax at the end of the day. The rule of thumb is that each applicable Trait the equipment has gives you an additional point of Relaxation when applicable. So, an extra soft, double padded, and tailored bedroll will always do you good but a waterproof tent will really only give you a bonus in inclement weather. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> When your Relaxation matches your current Stress, you heal 1 Stress and your Relaxation drops to 0 again. Yes, that means that the more Stressed you become, the harder it is to decompress yourself. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Also, as an aside here; the Musician and Cooking/Baking Advanced Skills also help heal Stress, so you can look into those.</p><h3>MENTAL BREAKDOWNS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> When your Total Stress equals your ( Int + Wis ) * 2, called your Stress Threshold, you've gotten to the point that you just can't take it anymore. This results in a Mental Breakdown for your character. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When this happens they do eveything in their power to separate themselves from the stressor as quickly as possible. If they're in a scenario that directly threatens their life (like combat or dangling from a cliff), they'll separate themselves as quickly as possible but will pay little attention to their companion's safety. At this point, they're so overwhelmed, they don't really care. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Until that Stress is all healed, any further Stress will not only give the usual penalties, but also deals 1 damage per point inflicted. This damage is all on one wound and is unhealed while the character is having a Mental Breakdown. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Should the character start to bleed out, they suffer a heartattack and die.</p><h1>VITALITY</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Vitality represents how close you are to passing out and dying. It is both your health and fatigue. As you take damage, you will get closer to death and gain more penalties.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Vitality is divided into 5 categories, representing what percentage of damage a character has taken: </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>FRESH: 0%</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>TIRED: >1%</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>HURT: >25%</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>BLOODIED: >50%</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>WOUNDED: >75%</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>BLEEDING OUT: >100%</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"> To calculate how much Vitality you have for each category, add a roll of your Primary Archetype’s Vitality Die to your Constitution + their Vitality Size Modifier. That’s your total. Divide that by 4. If you have a remainder, alternate between rounding down on every category except the Wounded category.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, if you’re a Human with and your Vitality Die is a d10 and you roll a 7 with a Constitution of 12, you have 29 Vitality. You’re Tired at 28, Hurt at 22, Bloodied at 15, and Wounded 8.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Record your Vitality Die roll on your character sheet. </p><h3>DROPPING A VITALITY CATEGORY & ENCUMBRANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> As stated, the more damage you take, the harder the fight becomes. When you drop a Vitality Category, you gain an amount of Stress equal to your Encumbrance.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your Encumbrance is equal to your Con Encumb. + Wis Encumb. + Encumb. from armor and shields + however many times you’re over your carry limit.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CHANGING ENCUMBRANCE WHILE WOUNDED</strong> The Stress you gain from wounds isn't healed by normal means; it's only healed when either your Encumbrance is lowered or when your wounds heal enough to move you up a category.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> That means, if you took 10 Stress dropping from a Vitality Category, taking a spa day wouldn't help. Instead, you should see a surgeon or a doctor. Now, what you could do is not carry so much gear around. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, for example, let's say that you have a base Encumbrance of 10 from your Abilities but you're carrying around only a Light Shield, so your actual Encumbrance is 16. You drop from Fresh to Hurt, and you gain 32 Stress because of it. You're in the middle of combat, so you can't Take a Breather, so you drop your shield, your Encumbrance drops to 10 and you heal 12 Stress, which isn't bad. After the battle, you take a moment to catch your breathe and so you're now only Tired. Since your Encumbrance is now 10 so you heal 10 Stress. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Now, the flip side of this is that if you become MORE Encumbered while wounded, you gain that amount of Stress instantly. So, continuing the above example, if you were to then pick up your Light Shield again, your Encumbrance would raise by 6 and you'd gain 6 Stress. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PASSING OUT</strong> All characters pass out when they start Bleeding Out, but it is possible that they'll pass out before then. If your remaining Vitality is greater than or equal to your Stress Penalty, your character collapses, helpless but not actively bleeding out. In a sense, he's forced to Take a Breather. or remain helpless.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if you've got 30 Stress and 29 Vitality, when you've taken 25 damage, you're character collapses, forced to Take a Breather.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Wound Category Exception</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Just as an aside - going from Fresh to Tired doesn’t count as changing a Wound Category for purposes of triggering a Trauma check.</p></td></tr></table><h3>TAKING A BREATHER</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Pausing and not doing anything but move at a Stroll while not Threatened for 20 Seconds - Con, minimum 3 Seconds, heals you half the damage (rounded down) that you've take since the last time you've Taken a Breather. Damage healed this way is taken from the smallest non-long term fatigue wound. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> If you become Threatened while taking a breather but continue to try and catch your breath, you take 1 Stress for every second you remain so.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’re attacked and still definitely rest, you reduce your defense dice by 1 size. If they miss, you’re breather is unaffected, though in either case, the attacker loses an Honor.</p><h3>HEALING</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Combat is dangerous. Even if you survive, you could end up with wounds that you carry with you for months on end.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Each time damage is done, it is tracked in a new wound.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Wounds heals at a slow rate. Each point takes a number of days equal to the damage done to heal it 1 point.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, a 5 point wound takes 5 days to become a 4 point wound, which takes 4 days to becomes a 3 point wound, and so on. That means it takes 15 days to completely heal ( 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thankfully, each wound heals simultaneously. So, if you have 3 separate 4 point wounds, you’ll be completely healed by day 10.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RECUPERATION (HEALING WITH RELAXATION)</strong> Another option you can do to speed up long term healing is to rest and indulge yourself. If the only Stress your character has is from Wounds, any points of Relaxation gained that day are taken off the days to heal off your Wounds. This is somewhat limited however since you can only drop a single Wound's days to heal by the amount it had left on that Severity. So, if I have a 10 Severity Wound, with 8 days of healing left, gaining 11 points of Relaxation, would only reduce it to a 9 Severity Wound with 9 days left to heal that day. However, if I also had another Wound, I could use that otherwise wasted Relaxation on it.</p><h1>HONOR</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Honor is a measure how not only how a person measures their own integrity but also how other people see them. Honor isn’t about doing the common sense thing; it’s about doing the heroic thing. People who run from a fight, even when outnumbered, lose Honor. People who let others talk bad about them and don’t get even lose Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The question of Honor isn’t a question of good and evil; many evil men have been honorable. It’s more about living up to the ideals of your culture and being true to your inner self.</p><h3>BONUS CrP</h3><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Bonus Honor </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Honor Of Last Character</td><td>Bonus Crp</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Great Honor</td><td>50</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>High Honor</td><td>35</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Average Honor</td><td>25</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Low Honor</td><td>10</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Dishonor</td><td>0</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"> If this is your first Bonfire character in a campaign, you receive a bonus 25 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’re here because you’ve had a character die, this bonus CrP is based on the Honor category your character was in when they died.</p><h3>STARTING HONOR</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Honor category in which you start is determined by your “Start Honor”, listed under your Charisma. You start at the bottom of the corresponding category.</p><h3>HONOR CATEGORIES & BONUSES</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Honor has its benefits. Confidence allows you to push yourself a little bit more than you otherwise would. During the game, you can spend your Honor points to influence anything, rolls or static metrics, whenever you want on a 1 to 1 basis. Doing so lowers your Honor but might save your character’s life. So, if you roll a 13 and your opponent rolls a 14, you could spend 3 Honor to beat their total. Likewise, if an enemy deals 8 damage to you and you have 6 Honor, you could spend all of it and only take 2 damage.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Additionally, each category has an Honor Dice, which can be rolled to add or subtract like Honor.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Honor cannot go above 25 or below 0. The size of the Honor Die is also determined at the beginning of session and doesn’t change during play even if the category does.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DISHONOR (0 - 5 Honor, No Honor Die)</strong> The lowest category, this person is unsure that they have what it takes to be a hero and so every decision is laced with hesitation and uncertainty.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LOW HONOR (6 - 10 Honor, d4!)</strong> This character hasn’t really proved anything, one way or another. Others and herself are waiting for her to make her mark on the world.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AVERAGE HONOR (11 - 15 Honor, d6!)</strong> Having reached this category, the character has shown that they have potential and some follow through.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HIGH HONOR (16 - 20 Honor, d8!)</strong> She has now separated herself from the common rabble and can stand a head above the crowd.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GREAT HONOR (20 - 25 Honor, d10!)</strong> This rare sliver represents those who can perfectly balance being ahead of others but not so much so that they invoke the ire of those below them as well as being confident while not being cocky.</p><h3>END OF SESSION HONOR AWARDS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> At the end of each session, the players will elect each other’s characters for things they think that character deserved Honor for. It is generally poor form to elect yourself but is also reasonable if you pulled off someonething amazing and the rest of the group didn't seem to notice.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These elections need to fit into one of these three categories:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STRENGTH</strong> This character demonstrated strength based on how their character’s culture defines strength, which could be physical prowess but could also be cunning or grifting.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MASTERY</strong> This is given when a character solves a tricky problem or came up with a creative solution. Note, this shouldn't be given for good rolls unless the players want to lose Honor for bad rolls; this is about out of the box thinking.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COURAGE</strong> When the chips were down, did your character give up the fight or did they really show what it means to be a hero and stare down death?</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ROLEPLAYING</strong> Did the player really role play his character? Where his decisions about what he thought gave him the best chance to win or was it about what his character thought would be a good idea? Note, that since players are electing each other, jackasses who use “that’s just what my character would do” to dick over the party won’t get rewarded for this much. This should be specifically linked to a character's Social Characteristics.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GAINING HONOR DICE</strong> Whenever you go up an Honor Category, you gain a free use of your Honor Dice. Also, when you reach 25 Honor, you get one as well, even though you didn't technically go up a category. Once used, they go away but they stay with your character as long as they live. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Certain Archetype abilities may also give you them temporarily, in which case, the Archetype will note for how long you have them. </p><p style="margin:0px;">For each of these categories, the GM can also dock Honor from a character. Did they run away or did they conveniently forget any Characteristics that would have screwed them over?</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">That and spending Honor are the two main ways of losing Honor.</p><h1>FAME</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A good majority of people want to be associated with heroes and legends, even the bad ones. Charles Manson gets love letters everyday, after all. Famous people soon find themselves surrounded by people willing to help for their 15 minutes. Some of these people may actually end up being useful in the long term. So, it’s important to track you Fame or try to increase it, if you can.</p><h3>GAINING & LOSING FAME</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> You gain Fame by doing things. This is primarily from completing Goals and Benchmarks but it can be from completing quests and simply bragging about your exploits in the local tavern.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The reason that Goals gain you more Fame than if you were just running around doing random fetch quests is because completing Goals creates a story that people want to talk about. Sure, they can talk about you slaying that dragon, but if it’s also the dragon that kidnapped your sister, that’s much more compelling and worth gossiping about at the local watering hole.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You lose Fame by not doing things. Every month your character doesn’t do anything new, people talk about her less and less. They lose 1 point of Fame for every month they don’t complete at least 1 Benchmark. </p><h3>FAME & HONOR</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Honor and Fame have a close tie as the more people talk about you, the more your reputation, whether good or ill, gets around.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At the end of each session, for every 10 points of Fame a character has, they gain an additional Honor point, but this is only added at the end of the session if they don’t end with a negative Honor pool. So, a character with 70 Fame that ends with -3 Honor, drops an Honor Category at the end of the session. </p><h3>ATTRACTING NPCS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">While a character may use the Recruiting skill to find hirelings at anytime, after a character reaches 50 Fame, they start having people seek them out. At that point, and at every 10 (or 25 for those with a Caster Archetype) Fame above that, the GM rolls on the Follower Attraction table.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These come in three varieties:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CAMP FOLLOWERS </strong>These are those that wish to swim in the wake of the big fish, often profiting off the other followers of the party and are often washerwoman, prostitutes, or errand boys. They don’t ask anything of the party but are happy to be hired on for specialty jobs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">They’re also the least loyal, abandoning the party should the party start to lose Retainers and they’ll never put their lives on the line for the party.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RETAINERS </strong>Retainers make up the paid help. They often seek out the party directly and have a basic skill. The idea is that the party will help them further their craft and connections for a bit of pay. They’ll make themselves as helpful as possible - such as repairing armor and weapons for the cost of room and board.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Retainers won’t break contract unless the captain of the party falls into Low Honor and will be more loyal than camp followers, however, they’ll only risk their lives if it’s in their contract to do so.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SIDEKICKS </strong>Sidekicks are something special. A Sidekick is a person who is completely loyal to a character. They would lay down their lives for a character. A character has a limited number of Sidekicks that he can call upon over the course of his whole life time.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Sidekicks are childhood friends, people who deify the character, or other such unquestionably loyal followers. </p><p style="margin:0px;">A Sidekicks is essentially a second Player Character that the player gets to run.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Any new follower can be declared by the player to be a Sidekick, having sought out the party, he is recognized as an old friend or a new friend who swears undying loyalty to the character. Additionally, a follower can be elevated to the status of a Sidekick if he or the character saves the other’s life.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Even before 50 Fame, a character can search out his Sidekicks, however, they must be old friends from his past, in this case.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Sidekicks start with an automatic d6 Devotion to the character and the character gains an equivalent Devotion in return.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Only severe abuse can break the bond between the hero and his Sidekick but should this happen, the Sidekick becomes an enemy of equivalent zeal.</p><h5>Masteries</h5><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Mastery Limitations</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> Masteries are sometimes natural gifts that either have been around since the character’s childhood or emerge during their adventuring career, or they’re specific area that your character has trained to develop.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> In any case, unless stated otherwise, you may only take a Mastery once.</p></td></tr></table><h1>GENERAL MASTERIES</h1><h3>A NOTCH ABOVE the REST</h3> <h3> CrP: 30</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Even in a crowd of kings, this person would stick out. They often carry themselves with the perfect blend of confidence and humility. Those with this Mastery max out their Honor at 30, instead of 25, however, they gain the additional Honor Dice once they reach 25 and then again at 30, though going above 25 doesn’t increase the size (in case you were wondering).</p><h3>AMBIDEXTROUS</h3> <h3> CrP: 30</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">With this mastery, a character is just as proficient with one hand as with the other, which may become helpful if they end up suffering an amputation. Mostly it means that they can better fight with a weapon in each hand. Rules for this are found in <strong>Chapter 10: Combat</strong>.</p><h3>ANTI-MAGICAL BLANK</h3> <h3> CrP: 30</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There’s just something about this character that refuses to give when spells are slung around her. She increases the Drain of any spell that affects her by 3. Caster Archetypes are barred from taking this Mastery.</p><h3>ANTIQUARIAN</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You may invoke a minor Relic’s power once per session for free and are considered 1 Honor Category higher for medium Relics.</p><h3>ARCANE GRIP</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> By sheer force of will and a natural connection to the Painted World, a character only loses 1 SP per 12 seconds while not channeling.</p><h3>ARCANE TRAINING</h3> <h3> CrP: *</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Mages, Speakers, and Wizards may increase their magical might through study and understanding in a way that other Caster Archetypes cannot. This is represented by Arcane Training which these Caster Archetypes can purchase.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> When you purchase an Arcane Training, you select one of the Weird Traditions. The price is 8 + 2 * (Current Ranks + number of previous Traditions trained in). Each purchase increases the Rank you have in that Tradition. Going back and purchasing more Ranks in a Tradition you’re already Trained in doesn’t “shift” it around for purposes of “number of previous Traditions trained in”.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, if you’re a Mage, and you train to become Rank 1 in Occultism, which costs you 8 CrP ( 8 + 2 * ( 0 + 0 ) ), and then train to become Rank 1 in Calling, which costs you 10 CrP ( 8 + 2 * ( 0 + 1 ) ), going back and becoming Rank 2 in Occultism would only cost you 12 ( 8 + 2 * ( 2 + 0 ) ).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When casting a spell of that Tradition, you gain a bonus of SP equal to your Rank in that Tradition. </p><h3>BELOVED</h3> <h3> CrP: 20</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some are just favored by the Divines, the teacher's pets of the celestial world. Increase your Max Favor by 1.</p><h3>CHARLATAN</h3> <h3> CrP: 40</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sometimes people have a gift for certain things and it allows to reach beyond their own training and adapt other styles into their own. This Mastery allows a character to choose a class ability from another Archetype and incorporate it into their class, however, this ability starts at first level and stays there, only “leveling up” if they invest 20 CrP into at their level up.</p><h3>CONCERT CASTER</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This character serves as an effective conduit to help others channel the Painted World and is considered an additional person when lowering the channelling time while Concert Casting.</p><h3>EARDSTAPA</h3> <h3> CrP: 10</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Created by the rangers of Yr Alban, this is an ad hoc language of marks and symbols sometimes called “Wander Signs”, used to communicate things to other people who might go the same way.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Often carved into trees or marked on stones, they provide useful information about the area in very simple, broad terms. Below are the most common signs:</p><img src="../bonfireSRD/src/assets/images/signs.png" alt="wander signs"> </div><h3>ELDRITCH ADEPT</h3> <h3> CrP: 10</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While they don’t exactly revel in it, a person can adjust to the sickening waves that result from spells. With this Mastery, this character gains 1 less Stress from weirdburn around them. Casters may also pick up this Mastery as well.</p><h3>EXTRA SPECIAL MIX</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Playing with guns and gunpowder is dangerous, but a little tinker may help you learn how to refine your powders so that your barker is way worse than your bite. With this Mastery, use the larger of the two damage dice to determine Flinch. For firelance, always use the highest rolled of the two damage dice.</p><h3>LINKED SOUL</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This character has an exceptionally special link with the lead caster while concert casting where they feel like one soul instead of two touching. Their channelling dice isn’t reduced one size if they’re directly touching the lead caster.</p><h3>HEIRLOOM</h3> <h3> CrP: 35</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This character has received a special gift from their family or their community: a Minor Relic. This Minor Relic needs to either be noted in the character's backstory as recieving one of these is a pretty big deal. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Servant characters receive a discount of 15 CrP and those with at least one Archetype with Inheritance receive a 10 CrP discount for this Mastery. Servant and Inheritance does stack with each other but two Inheritances don't. It can be picked up after Character Creation but only at double the price and there needs to be reason (such as a family member dying). </p><h3>HEROIC/VILLAIN SPIRIT</h3> <h3> CrP: 20</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When the chips are down, this character comes in swinging. Once per session, a character can increase their Honor Die by 1 size.</p><h3>TEACHER</h3> <h3> CrP: 20</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A great teacher can be worth their weight in gold: Any time an ally levels up, you and your companion may choose to train an extra day, if you do your ally may take a 5 CrP discount on any one Skill or Mastery you currently have. You must have a higher degree of mastery than your ally in order for them to receive the discount. </p><h3>THAUMATURGE</h3> <h3> CrP: 20</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character finds that certain Miracles are just easier to invoke than others. When you purchase this Mastery, select a specific Miracle. Increase your Honor Dice one size when invoking that specific Miracle. It still needs to follow the normal restrictions (so be sure to check with the GM to make sure the Miracle falls within your Covenant).</p><h1>COMBAT MASTERIES</h1><h3>ACUTE ALERTNESS</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This a character can sometimes start acting before they even consciously know that something is wrong, either through a natural survival instinct or years of training. This Mastery lowers the Initiative Die of the character by 1 size.</p><h3>ARMOR BASIC TRAINING</h3> <h3> CrP: *</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This basic training allows a character to more effectively utilize armor of different types based on their level of familiarity with them. It’s split into 3 categories:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LIGHT (15 CrP)</strong> This covers armor that tends to not to restrict the wearer so is often favored by skill centric characters.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MEDIUM (10 CrP)</strong> This armor is a bit heavier than Light armor and offers a tradeoff between protection and mobility.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HEAVY (10 CrP)</strong> The armor in this category is durable, thick, and heavy, able to withstand blows but at the cost of being hard to move in.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You have to buy armor training in sequence, starting at Light and moving all the way to Heavy.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can always try and use armor without the baseline knowledge of how to properly wear and don it, but the Defense penalty and Encumbrance are both doubled if that’s the case.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can further your training in armor to increase the benefits. See the Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training Sidebar for more details.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training are further training in those particular fields. They can only be taken for things that you already have Basic Training in. So, a character can’t take any masteries for any Medium Armor if he doesn’t have the Medium Armor Basic Training. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Every type will have categories you can specialize in. Each specialization in that area gives them a +1 for every Rank they obtain in it. This can't bring a negative bonus above 0 </p><p style="margin:0px;"> The price for increasing your Rank in a category is the Tier’s Base Cost + twice the current Rank.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can’t buy up a Rank again until you’ve either filled out all the rest of the category or you have two categories at that Rank. This is true all the way down so your Advanced Training for a weird looking triangle (as shown below). This is true even if you have reached the maximum benefit from a category.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> For example, let’s say that you want to increase your training in Scale Armor specifically, which have the stats of Def 0, Init 3, Recovery 1, and Encumbrance of 8. If you want to get a Rank 5 in Encumbrance (lowering it by 4 points), you would have to also buy a Rank 4 in one category, Rank 3 in another, and Rank 2 in a final thing. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Ideally, that means that you bought Rank 4 in Init, Rank 3 in Recovery, and Rank 2 in Def. Notice that that additional 2 Ranks in Recovery and that Rank 1 in Def doesn’t give you anything besides allowing you to reach Rank 4 in Encumbrance. </p><table style="border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td> </td><td>Rank 1</td><td>Rank 2</td><td>Rank 3</td><td>Rank 4</td><td>Rank 5</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Def</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Init</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Recovery</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Encumb</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Tiers don't stack with each other: you gain all the bonuses from a single Tier of your choice. If you have a +1 Attack and Damage in all weapons (Tier 5) and a +1 to Defence and -1 to Recovery in Polearms (Tier 2), while wielding a pike, you either gain the +1 Attack and Damage with it or +1 Defense and -1 Recovery, but not +1 Attack, Damage, Defense, and -1 Recovery.</p><h3>TIERS</h3><table style="width:225px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="3" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Tier Prices </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td> </td><td>Base Cost (Non-Fighter)</td><td>Base Cost (Fighter)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Tier 5</td><td>20</td><td>16</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Tier 4</td><td>16</td><td>12</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Tier 3</td><td>12</td><td>10</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>Tier 2</td><td>9</td><td>8</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Tier 1</td><td>8</td><td>8</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These are the base price based on specialization Tier:</p><h3>ARMOR</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AREAS</strong> Defense, Recovery Modifier, Encumbrance, Initiative </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Encumbrance lowers that armor's Encumbrance by 2 for every plus you have in it.</p><img src="../bonfireSRD/src/assets/images/armor.png" alt="All Armors (Tier 5), Armor Type (Light, Medium, Heavy) (Tier 4), Specific Armor/Unarmored (Tier 3)"> </div><h3>SHIELDS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AREAS</strong> Defense, Parry, Encumbrance, Breakage</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Encumbrance lowers that shield's Encumbrance by 2 for every plus you have in it.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Breakage increases each Shield Breakage Threshold by 2 points for every rank obtained. So, wielding a shield with 2 ranks in this area of Mastery means that your shield can take 19 points of damage before saving vs d20!+10, 24 before saving vs d20!, and 29 before saving vs d20!-10. This mastery doesn't effect weapon breakage.</p><img src="../bonfireSRD/src/assets/images/shield.png" alt="All Shields (Tier 5), Shield Size (Small, Medium, Large) (Tier 4), Specific Shield (Tier 3)"> </div><h3>WEAPONS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AREAS</strong> Attack, Damage, Defense, Recovery</p><img src="../bonfireSRD/src/assets/images/weaponsAdv.png" alt="All Weapons (Tier 5), Melee Weapons (Tier 4), Ranged Weapons (Tier 4), Damage Category (Crushing, Slashing, Piercing) (Tier 3), Personal Ranged (Tier 3), Siege (Tier 3), Specific Weapon Type (Axe, Sword, Crushing, etc) (Tier 2), Thrown (Tier 2), Mechanical (Tier 2), Direct Fire (Tier 2), Indirect Fire (Tier 2), Specific Weapon (Tier 1), Unarmed (Tier 1)"> </div><h3>UNARMED COMBAT MASTERIES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While you can gain Masteries in Unarmed like other weapons, because it’s not treated exactly like a weapon, you’ll have different areas in which you can become specialized in it.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AREAS </strong>Attack, Defense, Recovery, Effectiveness</p><p style="margin:0px;">Effectiveness is applied to the difference between the Attack and Defense for additional benefits if the attack hits.

This can be prepped ahead of time for the belly- and crossbows but not the composite, long, or war bows</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AIMING </strong>This is actually sighting your target and lining up the shot. This can be skipped, making it so you fire faster, but you roll attack on a d12! instead of the standard d20!. This can't bring a weapon below it's minimum weapon Recovery.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FIRING </strong>This is pulling the trigger or loosing the arrow. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Masteries that lower Recovery take from Missile Retrieval, Fuse, Loading, Drawing, and Aiming evenly but they can never reduce a single category to below 1 second.

Instead of gaining a lowering their Attack Dice 2 per Movement Category when using ranged weapons, they lower it by 1 per Movement Category.</p><h3>BLIND FIGHTING</h3> <h3> CrP: 30</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> By relying on other senses, a character can somewhat make up for the loss of their sight. They increase their attack and defense die by 1 size when in dim or dark lightning conditions. </p><h3>BORN GUNNER</h3> <h3> CrP: 5</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> For some people, there is nothing sweeter than the smell of blackpowder and the horribly loud bang? A symphony. This Mastery lowers the delay suffered by the person from firearms going off by 1 second. This can be purchased multiple times but the cost doubles each time (5, 10, 20, etc.). </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Being around firearms tends to make you less susceptible to the pure terror of firearms and so the cost of this master is discounted by 5 for everytime you flinch because of a firearm going off. </p><h3>COVER CHAMPION</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Increase your Cover dice by 1 size or consider yourself 5% if you already have flat cover.</p><h3>DASHER</h3> <h3> CrP: 15</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> One might describe this character as having a certain spring in their step and they use it to get up and going quicker than those around them. A person with this Mastery can increase their speed category by 2, allowing them to move from a Walk to a Run in a single second, for example.</p><h3>DEADEYE</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can see the whites of your enemy’s eyes, you can also get a good sense of where their vital organs are. When at -4 range or lower, add a d4! to your damage.</p><h3>DEADLY FLANKER</h3> <h3> CrP: 30</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You’ve trained yourself to seize openings when they flash by, jumping on every lapse in your opponent’s judgement. When flanking from the side, you lower your target’s defense die by 1, including the dice of those using shields (though they still get a chance to Parry). This doesn’t, however, give you any benefit for attacking from directly behind.</p><h3>DECEITFUL MEASURE</h3> <h3> CrP: 20</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Carefully positioning and moving offline can give you the edge to strike first or keep your opponent at bay. This Mastery increases the Measure of any weapon you wield by a 1/2 foot for determining who hits first but not for whether a person can Engage or get In Your Guard.</p><h3>MARATHONER</h3> <h3> CrP: 15</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Through training and breathing techniques, this character can fight and sprint longer than others. They receive a -1 to their Encumbrance.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can buy this Mastery multiple times, but the price increases by 2 each time. So, the second time, you gain a -2 for 17 CrP, the third -3 for 19, and so on.</p><h3>OPPORTUNISTIC FIGHTER (ATTACK)</h3> <h3> CrP: 30</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">By watching for openings and waiting to strike, a character can take advantage of any opening. This doubles the range for Near Perfect Attacks.</p><h3>OPPORTUNISTIC FIGHTER (CQC)</h3> <h3> CrP: 30</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">By watching for openings and waiting to strike, a character can take advantage of any opening and slip instead their guard. On a Near Perfect Attack or Defense, this character can close in or retreat one range position.</p><h3>OPPORTUNISTIC FIGHTER (DEFENSE)</h3> <h3> CrP: 30</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">By watching for openings and waiting to strike, a character can take advantage of any opening. This doubles the range for Near Perfect Defenses.</p><h3>FLEET FOOTED</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A fleet-footed character tends to win foot races as he just goes flat out faster than those around him. His Running speed is increased by 2.5 feet / second and his Sprinting speed is increased by 5 feet / second.</p><h3>HEALTHY</h3> <h3> CrP: 20</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Nothing can stop this juggernaut, especially not weapons. This Mastery gives the character a one time, but permanent +1d8 to their Vitality. This dice is affected by the Min Vitality of that character's Con. </p><h3>IMPROVED DEFENSE</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Through muscle training or by simply having a talent for placing their shield in the right place at the right time, the character is able to move effectively parry blows that would otherwise land. Each purchase of this Mastery allows the character to increase their defense dice by 1 size verses one attacker up to their standard defense die. Each additional purchase doubles the cost of this Mastery.</p><h3>IRON SIDES</h3> <h3> CrP: 35</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is a nickname often given to these characters. Whether through ritual scarification or just simply having thick skin, this character has a natural +1 DR.</p><h3>QUICK HEALING</h3> <h3> CrP: 15</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some people just bounce back from wounds that would have put others down for months. With this Mastery, a character heals 1 day quicker for each level of wound severity. So, a 5 Severity Wound would heal in 10 days ( 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0) instead of 15 ( 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1).</p><h3>SHARP SHOOTER</h3> <h3> CrP: 35</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Careful aim can get you so far; sometimes, some people are just born with an eye for distance. The penalties for long ranged shots are lowered from 16 to 12, and from 32 to 24.</p><h3>SHIELD BASIC TRAINING</h3> <h3> CrP: 10</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> This teaches a character the basic understanding of how to properly use and employ shields in combat. This training covers all types of shields.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can always try to use a shield without the training, however, you gain a -4 to your defense when doing so.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can further your training in shields to increase the benefits. See the Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training Sidebar for more details.</p><h3>SHIELD BREAKER</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> With an innate understanding on resonance and timing, this character can target the weak spot of a shield, causing it to break more easily. This character rerolls the Shield and Weapon Breakage Theshold by 5 when dealing out Shield Damage.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This bonus does apply to the Strike the Weapon Combat Tactic, however, weapons with no Shield Damage don’t gain any benefit from this Mastery.</p><h3>SURE FOOTED</h3> <h3> CrP: 20</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A solid stance or a dense physique, this character is harder to move. This Mastery increase your character’s Vitality Size Modifier for Knock-Backs by 5 and gives you a +5 to defense against Pushes and Throws. </p><h3>UNYIELDING</h3> <h3> CrP: 30</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Like a warrior of old, this guy could take a spear right through the gut and keep fighting. For Trauma checks, this character rolls a 1d12, instead of a d20.</p><h3>WEAPON BASIC TRAINING</h3> <h3> CrP: 10</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> By gaining the basic understanding of how a weapon is wielded, used and taken care of, you not only expand its longevity, but also your longevity on the battlefield.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Weapon training is taken for individual weapons, however its benefits extend to weapons of that share similar features.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A person completely untrained in weapons both Attacks and Defends with that weapon using a d12!. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> However, one trained uses a d20! Attack and Defense (depending on whether or not they use a shield). </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, this is extended to any weapon that shares similar qualities as defined by the Weapon Tiers, up to Tier 4.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> For example, a character with training only in the Dusack extends that training to all melee weapons.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A character with training in both a Melee and Ranged weapons, gains that training to all weapons. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, why would you take training in multiple weapons once you have one melee and one ranged? Because this training allows you to further master that weapon, increasing its usefulness.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can further your training in weapons to increase the benefits. See the Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training Sidebar for more details. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Minimum Weapon Recovery</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> How fast a weapon can move and maneuver is ultimately limited by its size and balance and no matter how much you train, you can’t overcome that hurtle. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Small Melee Weapons: 2 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Medium Melee Weapons: 3 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Large Melee Weapons: 4 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Small Ranged Weapons: 3 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Medium Ranged Weapons: 4 Seconds</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Large Ranged Weapons: 5 Seconds</strong></p></td></tr></table><h3>WINDAGE</h3> <h3> CrP: 20</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">By compensating for wind, range, and other factors, an archer can take some control over a bad situation. This Mastery allows you to roll 2d4s on a ranged missed and keep whichever one you want.</p><h1>SKILL MASTERIES</h1><h3>DANGER SENSE</h3> <h3> CrP: 20</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> There are people who have an ability to know when things are up and guess at how difficult something is going to be. Even if they can’t put a finger on, they can get a sense of the danger (Get it? That’s the name of the Mastery).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Those with this Mastery get to know how many Obstacles are in play during a Skill Challenge; when they’re added and when they’re removed. This doesn’t tell them what they are, why type, or how difficult, but it does give them a good sense of how complex the situation is.</p><h3>DILIGENT RESEARCHER</h3> <h3> CrP: 10</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Those that have trained themselves to study, listen, and watch, can make more out of resources as their fingers than others. When using an Asset, those with this Mastery half the Time Investment. </p><h3>EASY OPERATOR</h3> <h3> CrP: 30</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Some people come alive under pressure: some people are alive to begin with. When making a Skill Check in a Skill Challenge vs Passive Opposition, they gain a +3 to their rolls.

When recovering Stress through hobbies, this Mastery increases the amount they recover by 1. </p><h3>KNACK</h3> <h3> CrP: 10</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Sometimes people have a gift for certain things. When buying this Mastery, the character selects a Skill Suite. They get one free reroll per session for this Skill Suite or any of its Advanced Skills. This can be for a Skill Check or it can be for any Leverage you brought in because of that Skill.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They can buy Knack multiple times, selecting the same or different skill, however each purchase costs 10 CrP more each time.</p><h3>MULTITASKER</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some people can keep their minds in two places. When Multitasking, those with this Mastery gain an extra d4! to one of their Skill Checks.</p><h3>OLD FRIEND</h3> <h3> CrP: 15*</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character didn’t start in a vacuum and he’s got resources he can draw on when he needs a helping hand. When you purchase this Mastery, you gain an Asset; it can actually be a friend but it can also be a membership to a club, a parent with a library, or whatever else you can think of. The Time Investment starts at 2 Hours and their Rank in a Skill of your choosing starts at 5.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Players subtract their Charisma from the price and don’t have to redeem it right away, however, once redeemed (and defined), however, it can’t be changed.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Mastery can be bought multiple times, each time gaining a new Asset they can use, but each purchase adds 5 to the price.</p><h3>ON YOUR TOES</h3> <h3> CrP: 20</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you think quickly and stay on your toes, you can get away with what others can’t. One you purchase this Mastery, choose an Advanced Skill. Once per session, when using that Skill in connection with one of the Strategies, you forgo rolling or gaining a Stress Die.</p><h3>POLYGLOT</h3> <h3> CrP: 15</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has the gift of gab and can pick up on other languages quicker than most, learning the nuances of phrases and meanings. Any language that the polyglot gains Rank 4 or above in is considered a native tongue for her.</p><h3>PRODIGY</h3> <h3> CrP: *</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Some characters have just a flair or talent for a certain skill set that makes learning the subject a breeze. Characters with this Mastery get a discount of 3 CrP for 1 Advanced Skill, chosen at the time they purchase this Mastery. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Skill you choose also determines the price. Take the unmodified cost of that Skill and multiply it by 2. You can take this Mastery multiple times but each time increases the price by the unmodified cost of the Skill, however, you can't pick the same Skill twice. </p><h3>REAL HELPER</h3> <h3> CrP: 15</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When times get tough, sometimes the tough get helping.

When you buy this Mastery you must select Food, or Water. For Long Term Exhaustion, you half each threshold, allowing you to survive (and indulge) yourself on less.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, if you selected Food, you can Indulge on 2.5 lbs of food, go on Maintenance on 1.5 lbs, and suffer from Deprivation under .5 lb.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can buy this Mastery twice, the first for the base price, the second time for 35 CrP. The second time you purchase it, you get the other option so you can’t pick the same thing the second time, sorry.</p><h3>TEAMWORK TRAINING</h3> <h3> CrP: 15</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While helping another person in a Skill Challenge by using the Helper Skill, only one of you takes the Stress Die.</p><h3>THIEVES CANT</h3> <h3> CrP: 35</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Much like Eardstapa, Thieves Cant is an ad hoc language used for members of the many trades, but instead of marks, they use clothing and turns of phrase to communicate their intentions to others. Thieves Cant gives the ability to say things without saying them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thieves Cant is based on call and response, with confirmation and steps. The examples below are taken from the I Duchi Selvaggi version of the Cant, which is the most common and from which other Cants draw their lineage from.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LAY OF THE LAND</strong> This is before contact is made. The agent is looking for an initial contact. He’s look specifically for two of something; two rings, two scarves, two knives, etc.. The place the twins are in signifies what line of work the person is in. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Left Ear: Counterfeiting</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Right Ear: Con Artist</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Neck: Assassination</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Right Bicep: Smuggling</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Right Wrist: Intimidation</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Left Wrist: Fence</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Stocking: Espionage</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Left Thumb & Pink: Interrogation</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Left Index: Trapfinding</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Left Middle Finger: Security</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Left Pinky: Kidnapping</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Right Index: Theft</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Right Middle: Forgery</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Right Ring Finger: Recon</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Right Index & Pink: Burglary</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>APPROACH & CONFIRMATION</strong> Now, because it’s entirely possible that someone wears two necklaces or two rings on their right index finger, the agent has to do an approach. This is usually a code phrase disguised as an innocuous sentence followed by an innocuous reply.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The key here is that often the two professionals don’t know who the other is, so an overtly familiar greeting from a strange is usually a give away they’re a master of the many trades.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The most common use of Thieves Cant is gathering information. In this case, after the confirmation they ask if you’d like to play cards.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The new thief then pays money into the pot for each card played, paying for the information he’s getting, as he asked about the other’s estates, friends, and family.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Hearts is safe, meaning he’s a friend and can be trusted, Diamond means you asked about a good mark, Clubs is heavily guard, and Spades means the person in question is looking for work.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The dealer may also talk about people, places, or things; the card he deals when he brings them up applying to them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Here’s some common Cant phrases:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>"You settled down yet?": Are you working with a guild or are you solo?</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>"How's your mother's health?": How difficult is the job?</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>"I think that tower's at least 14 spans high": You'll give me 14 sc for the job</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>"No, you're crazy, I'm sure it's only 10": No, I won't. You'll get 10</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>"Aren't you a sight for sore eyes": Hide me</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>"Haven't seen you in awhile": Lay low</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This should be roleplayed out, with the player with Thieves Cant getting a Wisdom check to clarify anything that didn’t quite come through.</p><h3>TOOL ADEPT</h3> <h3> CrP: 15</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When applying equipment to a Skill Check, you increase the dice it gives you by 1 size. If you're using equipment in a Conflict, you increase its Leverage dice size by 1 as well.</p><h1>SOCIAL MASTERIES</h1><h3>AGGRESSIVE FIGHTER</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Between the options of retreating and attacking, this person attacks, knowing, if there's any doubt, any hesitation on their part could make it worse. In a Morale Conflict, this character can't be forced to take defensive actions. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Mastery costs 5 CrP if you have a Trait that could be defined as Aggressive. You can't take this Mastery if you've taken the Defensive Fighter Mastery. </p><h3>ANIMAL MAGNETISM</h3> <h3> CrP: 15</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some people have that inner force that comes with total confidence, allowing them to quickly put others on the back foot. In a Conflict, if you have higher Honor than your opponent, you automatically gain a point.</p><h3>CRONY</h3> <h3> CrP: 15</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some people don't like the spotlight and are happy to help others. During a Conflict, if you rolled the least amount of dice in a round and your side still won the Appeal, you gain 1 Honor.</p><h3>DEFENSIVE FIGHTER</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Between the options of retreating and attacking, this person retreats, knowing, if there's any doubt, that the safest option is always to fall back and regroup. In a Morale Conflict, this character can't be forced to take aggressive actions. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Mastery costs 5 CrP if you have a Trait that could be defined as Defensive. You can't take this Mastery if you've taken the Aggressive Fighter Mastery. </p><h3>GOAL ORIENTED</h3> <h3> CrP: 15</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Where others are directed by their goals, this person directs them. If they have a Goal that relates to the Conflict, you gain 1 point for each Goal.</p><h3>GOAL SYNERGY</h3> <h3> CrP: 15</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Goals working together is a beautiful thing and makes you more sure of your path. Reduce the Repercussion dice by 1 size per Goal that applies to the Conflict. If it would reduce it below a d3!, you’re automatically considered to have rolled a 1 on your Repercussions though this effect doesn’t stack.</p><h3>IDIOSYNCRATIC</h3> <h3> CrP: 20</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some people don’t see the point of going against what they see as their true nature. A person with this Mastery gains an automatic +5 to their roll whenever they make an Appeal with a Flaw.</p><h3>HARDENED RESOLVE</h3> <h3> CrP: 15</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When it comes down to the wire, this character doesn’t give up. Increase your Stress Threshold by 5.</p><h3>NEVERMIND, FORGET IT</h3> <h3> CrP: 30</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sometimes you know you’re beaten and the only solution is to get out of there with at least some of your dignity intact. When you lose a Conflict, either by Folding or just simply backing out, you only lose half the Honor (rounded down) or gain half the Stress you otherwise would have.</p><h3>RENAISSANCE MAN</h3> <h3> CrP: 10</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A true Renaissance man is a man (or woman) of many and powerful interests and they know how to use them to charm others. When you purchase this Mastery, designate a Passion; you can use it twice in a Conflict.</p><h3>SPECIAL BOND</h3> <h3> CrP: 10*</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> The battlefield can forge unlikely friendships, healing old scars by inflicting new ones on other people. These characters have put racial amenity aside and have grown to respect each other.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This Mastery can only be taken by two characters who’s races don’t have a racial preference above Tolerate for each other. Their race is considered Preferred for each other, though this doesn’t extend to others of the same race.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, an elf and an orc that have gotten over their distrust for the other won’t cause each other Stress but that elf traveling with another orc will.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Both characters must pay the Mastery cost for it to take effect. Each person subtracts the max size of their Devotion die for each other from the price. So, a human who has a d12 Devotion to an orc can purchase this Mastery for 18 CrP.</p><h3>STRONG OPENER</h3> <h3> CrP: 25</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A good opening salvo can really put you ahead and this character has a sense for it. If you beat (but not tie) your opponent in the first round, you gain 2 points.</p><h5>Skills</h5><p style="margin:0px;"> Skills are used as a way to determine the success or failure of a given action, based on what your character knows about the given subject or about how to perform the given task. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You don’t have to use these rules all the time, i.e., you don’t have to roll to see if your character successfully walks across a room, but at times they’re a good way to semi-randomly determine the outcome of a tricky task, i.e., walking across a room full of traps. </p><h1>SKILL INTRODUCTION</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> There are two types of skills that you’re going to be pulling from: Skill Suites and Advanced Skills.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Skill Suites represent broad swathes of knowledge that cover a variety of subjects. Suites are hard to increase because there’s so much ground to cover but can be used if you don’t have the specific Advanced Skill. An example of this is the Survival and Lore Skill Suites.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Advanced Skills are more tightly focused, covering one intellectual discipline. They’re easier to master but may not be applicable in every case. An example of this would be the First Aid, Fire Building, and Foraging skills in the Survival Skill Suite and the Arcana, History, and Medicine skills in the Lore Skill Suite.</p><h3>ACQUIRING SKILLS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Throughout your character’s career, she’ll acquire and improve her skills. Both types of skills are purchased with CrP, that is spent either at Character Creation or on leveling up. All skills have a unique cost that represents how easy or difficult they are to master. You pay the price as noted in the section below, you improve the skill.</p><h3>CALCULATING RANK</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL SUITES </strong>Your Skill Suites, your starting Rank is the Skill Bonus listed under the corresponding Stat. For Suites with multiple Stats, average the Skill Bonus, rounded down. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ADVANCED SUITES </strong> Your starting Rank for Advanced Skills is the Rank for the mother Skill Suite.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PURCHASING A SKILL </strong>Advanced Skills cost their Base Cost - Skill Bonus + (Current Rank * 2), while Skill Suites cost their Base Cost Base Cost - Skill Bonus + (Current Rank * 5), both have a minimum of 1. Note that, like Skills Suites above, if there are multiple Stats attached to a Skill, average the Skill Bonus, rounded down.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Every purchase increases your Rank in that Skill by 1. Purchases of Skill Suites also raises the Rank of any child Advanced Skills you’ve already purchased, so that’s nice.</p><h3>SKILL SPECIALIZATIONS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">It often pays to specialize. After all, many dissertations cover extremely minute subjects with incredible depth and drawing on that well of knowledge can be a huge benefit.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Skill Specializations represent an area of knowledge within an Advanced Skill that your character spends extra time versing themselves in. As such, they gain a bonus.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Skill specializations come in layers, modifiers that narrow down the field. Each layer gives a +1 to your effective Rank when it comes into play.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For example, a monster hunter studying predators, would gain a+1 Rank, while another that studies flying predators would gain a +2 Rank bonus to their checks, and a monster hunter that studies the flying predators of the Uchka Mountains would gain a bonus of +3 to their Rank.</p><p style="margin:0px;">There may come a time when a specialization only kind of applies. In this case, it may be kind of helpful, as the max bonus that can be gained from it is +1.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, when encountering a land predator in the Uchka Mountains, all three monster hunters would only gain +1 to their Rank.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">That sort of super-focused study takes a lot of time and effort and man only has so much time and energy to give. The total number of specializations per Advanced Skill that a character can have is equal to half his Intelligence score.</p><p style="margin:0px;">A character can gain a specialization like any other skill; having his character go out of the way to learn more about his craft. The price is the base cost of the Advanced Skill times the number of layers in the specialization plus one.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A character can go back and increase the number of layers in his Skill Specialization after his initial purchase of it, but it costs additional amount of CrPs equal to twice the base cost of the Advanced Skill.</p><h1>THE BASICS (SKILL CHECKS)</h1><p style="margin:0px;">Before we go off talking about Skill Challenges, time, equipment, and all those other things, it’s first important to understand the very basic mechanic all of those things will hang off of: Skill Checks.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Skill Checks are any checks made that move the Skill Challenge along and determines a success or failure.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At their very basic, Skill Checks have both sides rolling a d20! and adding any applicable Skill’s Rank and any modifiers for difficulty. The person with the highest total wins and you successfully bypass or eliminate the Obstacle, depending on the situation.</p><p style="margin:0px;">It is assumed that your character is trying their hardest to be successfully in whatever they attempt and so any Check you make inflicts 5 Stress. However, you can buy down that Stress with points off your total result on a 1 to 1 basis. You declare this before you get the results of the Check, however. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, let's you're making a Check to see if a pillar you're inspecting is load bearing. You have Rank 5 in Craft (Carpentry) and you roll an 18. Your total is 23 ( 18 + 5 ) but you're confident that you'll succeed due to the high roll so you tell the GM that you got a 21 total and take 3 Stress, instead of 5. </p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Answering a Question</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Another use of a single use Skill Check is answering a question that you don’t know the answer to like “out of these two walls, which looks easier to climb?” Things that would be reasonable for them to be there but you don’t know because you didn’t prepare for that question.</p></td></tr></table><h1>SKILL CHALLENGES</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Skill Checks refer to a single roll against a single Skill, while a Skill Challenge refers to a host of Skill Checks. To use a metaphor: a Skill Challenge would be breaking into the castle. The Skill Checks would be climbing the walls, hiding in the shadows, sneaking past the guards, listening at doors, lockpicking any locks, etc.</p><h3>OBJECTIVES AND OBSTACLES</h3><p style="margin:0px;">A Skill Challenge doesn’t exist without something that your character wants and at least one thing that stands in their way.</p><p style="margin:0px;">This could be something straightforward: I want to get out of this jail cell but a locked door is in my way, or it could be something more complicated like I want to capture this outlaw but he’s several days’ ride ahead of me.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These are your Objective and Obstacles, respectively.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Achieving your Objective is a matter of beating or getting past all the Obstacles in your way.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Obstacles are beaten through successfully rolling Skill Checks, which will be discussed more in the next section. Note that an Obstacle can continue to be a factor that needs to be considered, for example, a guard patrol, or it can be something that only needs to be taken care of once, for example, unlocking a door.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Obstacles also have Failure Threshold, which represents badly you have to fail against them to actually fail. More on this in the Failures, Hard & Soft section below.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>The Single Check</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Before we dive in, I think it's worth saying that there may be times when you have something that might call for a Skill Check but not a Skill Challenge. Most often you'll do this when there is danger but not a huge time crunch, like, for instance, players leaping over a cliff or when there’s a chance of failure, like the player not knowing a monster weakness.</p><p style="margin:0px;">In that case, it would be perfectly reasonable to just call for a single Jumping (or Monster Craft) Check. If the players want to do some Preparation or use any of the other tools at their disposal, they can.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Or, if there is a time crunch but it is so narrow players really wouldn't have the time to prepare, like having to jump the chasm while a horde of brigands with bows are closing it, you might also just default to the single roll: no need to break out these rules in that case.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In these cases, the Failure Threshold of the Check would be 1, meaning a failure is a failure, but you can spice it up by having the jump almost make it but now the player is just barely hanging out: however much time you want to spend on it.</p></td></tr></table><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Multi-Layer Checks</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Let's say that you're trying to deduce facts about bears before you go to fight one. The thing is, there is a lot to know about bears and your character probably isn't going to know all of it, so making a single Check is too binary while making multiple Checks is too tedious. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In steps the Mutli-Layer Check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In this case, the GM would assign Difficulty Dice to the different facts about bears based on how esoteric the knowledge is. He would then roll 1 d20! and all of those Difficulty Dice. You would only roll a single Check and the compare that to the difference totals to see if you recall those facts. </p><p style="margin:0px;">So, for instance, the knowledge that they habernate is no common but it's not uncommon, do the GM assigns that d6!. The knoweldge that they're afraid of fire is common, so he rolls d4! for that and the knowledge that they're sacred animals to the local indigious tribe is pretty rare because said tribe is extremely secretative so that would be a d20!. </p><p style="margin:0px;">You roll your Monster Craft and get a total of 16. The GM gets a 13 for the d20, a 4 for the d4!, a 5 for the d6! and a 1 for the second d20!. That means the totals are 17, 18, and 14 respectively. This means your character hasn't really been around bears to he doesn't know that they hibernate or that you can scare them with fire, however, he does recall over hearing some of the wanderers in the local tavern talk about how the animal was sacred to the local tribe and killed one of them after he wounded one of the creatures. </p></td></tr></table><h3>DIFFICULTY</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Difficulty is a dice that is added to the Skill Check based on things that might be going on at the time to either help or hinder your success.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, for example, finding food to eat while living off the land is much easier in a forest than it is in, say, a desert. In the forest, the players would receive a +d8! to their roll while in the desert the other side, the Obstacle, would get a +d20!. This is in addition to the base d20!, by the way.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Obstacles can have static, variable, shrinking, circular, growing, or "universal" difficulties. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STATIC </strong>means that the dice pretty much stays the same, outside of player interaction. This is often used for one off checks and not really used as the main part of a Skill Challenge because, let’s face it, doing the same Check over and over again isn’t that interesting.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>VARIABLE </strong>means that the Obstacle has multiple Checks associated with it but that the difficulty variables wildly over time. So, for instance, a rock wall that is slippery at the base, then has a section with a lot of handholds, and finishes with an overhang, would be three separate Checks, the first with a d12! difficulty for the wall, the next with a d4! for the players, and the final with a d10!, again for the wall.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHRINKING </strong>means that it starts high but then the dice shrinks as time passes, often becoming static at a certain point. This is when the threat becomes less and less severe, and I would use this sparingly and with other types of Obstacles, but it can represent the fact that leaving a place is often easier than getting in.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GROWING </strong>is the opposite of shrinking: it starts low and then increases as time passes, again, sometimes becoming static at a certain point. This is used to represent threats that continue to grow, often times when there is time pressure.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>UNIVERSAL </strong>This is a term for an Obstacle that will go off at sometime but won't be directly faced by the players. It represents a chance encounter, such as running into someone randomly, or a stroke of bad luck, like bad weather. Unlike other Obstacles, players won't make Checks directly against it but any Failure (or Success) against another Obstacle in that Challenge adds a like amount of Failure (or Success) to any Universal Obstacles.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CIRCULAR </strong>means it starts at a difficulty, grows to a certain difficulty, and then shrinks down to its original difficulty, rinse and repeat, ad nauseam. It can also start shrinking, if you’d like. This is often used as patrols, like guards and such, but also a monster stalking an area would be represented by this type of Obstacle though you would have it be a bit more random to represent that unpredictability.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, for instance, a guard patrol that makes a loop around the house would be a good example of a Circular Obstacle. When the patrol is furthest away from where the players are breaking in, the difficulty to not be detected by them is 0 so they add nothing to their roll, but when the guards are right on top of the players breaking in, the difficulty is +d20!. If it takes them 7 minutes to get from that furthest point to the players, that means every minute, the difficulty for the players increases by 1 dice size.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But, as the guards finish their circlate, heading back to the furthest point away from the players, the difficulty shrinks by 1 size per minute.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>"Pausing" the Skill Challenge</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">The players don’t always have to be making Skill Checks during a Skill Challenge - they should only do so when it makes sense.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, (using the above example) if the patrols aren’t very good and the guards get too far away from the players to reasonably hear them, no Check should be required.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But that doesn’t mean that time stops: if the players wait long enough, the guards will return and Checks will need to start up again.</p></td></tr></table><h3>FAILURES, HARD & SOFT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Failing a Check doesn’t automatically mean that you’re instantly screwed: Failing a single Move Silently Check doesn’t result in the guards catching you. In Bonfire, there are soft failures and hard failures.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Soft failures are when you fail a single Skill Check. How much you failed by is added to the Failure of the Obstacle you’re making the Check against and your Stress, while how much you succeed by due to help is just added to that Failure. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When that Failure goes over that Obstacle’s Failure Threshold, you get a hard failure for that Obstacle. Hard failures are when something bad actually happens. In this case, it does result in you getting caught by the guards, or it results in your falling off the wall and taking damage. Even after a hard failure, you can sometimes try again, like in the case of falling off the wall.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Failure doesn’t diminish during the Skill Challenge but it does reset for a new one.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Soft Failure in the Narrative</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Soft Failures don’t mean that the Skill Challenge grinds to a halt while the players keep reattempting that Skill: instead it should represent the players coming closer to danger.</p><p style="margin:0px;">For a quick example, let’s say that there’s an adventurer, we’ll call him New York Smith, York for short, who is attempting to jump a chasm, which has a Failure Threshold of 10.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">He rolls his Check but fails by 7. In this case, he obviously jumped but also didn’t make it. What does that mean? Well, New York didn’t quite make it but managed to grab the ledge as he fell, so he didn’t fall to his death but he isn’t safe either: the GM can make a roll for another Check to see if he can scramble up the sides, but that probably won’t be a Jumping Check.</p></td></tr></table><h3>ACTIVE & PASSIVE OBSTACLES</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Another thing to consider is whether or not the Obstacle is Active or Passives.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PASSIVE </strong>means that whomever you’re up against doesn’t realize they’re up against you. This is the, for example, the watchman doing his nightly rounds or the river you have to cross.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ACTIVE </strong>means that whomever you’re up against realizing something is amiss and is now actively working against you. This doesn’t mean you're caught: it just means the person is on high alert.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Inanimate objects can also become “Active” though. While not the most appropriate term for it, it still represents a dangerous situation that suddenly occurs that makes failure more deadly, such as having your safety line snap while climbing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BECOMING ACTIVE AND PASSIVE </strong>Passive is the default state for an Obstacle to be in, so you don’t really need to do anything special.</p><p style="margin:0px;">A Passive Obstacle becomes Active when you fail a Check against it.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Active Obstacle adds the amount of Failures it has to its Check, making it that much harder to succeed against it.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">An Active Obstacle goes back to being Passive if you succeed at a Skill Check without any help (outside of Honor).</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Staying Active</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Now, most NPCs will stay Active for 1d4! hours unless they have a Characteristic that affects how diligent they are, but what about players? A person, NPC or not, gains 3 Stress for every hour they remain Active, so yeah, your players can remain ever vigilant but they'll be mental wrecks in a week or so.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">What about if the players want to come back to try again? They can with any Active penalty they gained diminishing by 3 for every hour the Obstacle is Passive.</p></td></tr></table><h1>STRATEGIES</h1><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Stress Dice</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">Much like in a Social Conflict, your character is probably going to get Stress Dice. Note that, unless it says otherwise, that dice is a d6!.</p><p style="margin:0px;">When any of these tools note that you roll a Stress Dice, if you don’t have one, you simply gain one that then waits in the wings to be rolled the next time you roll a tool. You can gain multiple Dice this way without rolling them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At the end of Challenge, you roll all Stress Dice and add it to your Character’s Stress.</p></td></tr></table><h3>ASSETS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">These represent static pools of knowledge or information that you can pull from. So, for instance, a book on the subject, or a library are examples of an Asset but also an old friend who used to be a ranger could give you a few pointers so could give you a bonus to the Navigation Check you’re going to have to make to find those ruins. </p><p style="margin:0px;">Basically, anything you can think of that might apply might be an Asset you can draw on.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Assets add their Skill Rank to your Check, however this happens slowly based on that Asset's Time Investment. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For each period of the Time Investment you spend with the Asset, you gain a +1 to one of your future Checks, up until the Asset's Rank.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, you go to your old ranger friend to get information about the local area. You know he happens to be a talker, so you know it’ll take you at least 2 hours (his Time Investment) to start to get anything useful out of him so you decide to spend the day with him, spending about 8 hours there.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Now, your friend doesn’t remember as much as he used to so his Navigation is Rank 3. After spending 8 hours with him, you get a +3 to your Navigation Prep Check. If you have stayed 6 or 7 hours, you would have still gotten that +3, while if you had stayed for 2 hours, you would have only gotten only a +1.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You don’t automatically know the Rank or the Time Investment of an Asset.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Another benefit of Assets is that they allow you to do multiple Preparation for a single Skill Check and the same Asset can be used to Prepare for multiple different checks. A library, for example, could allow you to Prepare for both a Monster Craft and History check.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Assets can also be increased and expanded upon as well, increasing its Rank. A good relationship with a contact might give you information quicker, donating to the local library may increase its selection, or hiring excavators to dig up a ruin may unearth more artifacts that help you decipher that ancient script.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There may be some special cases where an Asset will take care of itself but you may have to check back on it, such as Snaring in the forest. You set your trap and then a day or two later, you can go back and check it to see if you caught anything - in the meantime, you can get other work done.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Using Other Players As Assets</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">I think it's completely reasonable that players would want to use each other's characters as Assets and why shouldn't they? So, in this case, the Time Investment is set at 2 hours and 45 minutes - the character's Intellect * 3 in minutes. This means that a character with an Intellect of 13 has a Time Investment of 2 Hours, 6 Minutes. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">GMs should also feel free to reward players who sit there and talk things out and plan by awarding the Asset bonus as well, even if they don't spend a full hour+ planning.GMs should also feel free to reward players who sit there and talk things out and plan by awarding the Asset bonus as well.</p></td></tr></table><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Assets & Equipment Based Skills</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Some skills are only going to be useful if you have the proper equipment or the right Asset. For instance, if you’re not out in the wilderness, you can’t really use Snaring or if you don’t have the proper tools or a woodshop, Maintenance won’t do you any good. This will need to be handled on a case to case basis.</p></td></tr></table><h3>EQUIPMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Your kit can really pull you through in a pinch.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Players are assumed to be using any and all equipment that would help them with a check and you can choose to have one or more of these pieces of equipment to give you, in that moment, a reroll one of one your dice (taking the better of the two). You can have multiple pieces of equipment apply but the reroll can only be redeemed once per Check.</p><p style="margin:0px;">On top of this, if the gear you’re using has Traits that applies, you add any of those applicable bonuses to whichever roll you keep.</p><p style="margin:0px;">For the first redemption of this bonus between Maintenance Prep Checks this comes with no penalty but every time after that, the tool degrades, giving it a -1 regardless of whether you succeed or not. While players are assumed to be using all equpment that might be useful without having to specifically state as such, if a player did point out how a piece of equipment is being used to help them, they're automatically considered to have made a Maintenace Check before using it if they have that Skill.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can use faulty equipment (ones with a negative modifier), since something is better than nothing. This still gives you a reroll but it’s on 1 dice lower (again, keeping the better of the two).</p><h3>HELPER SKILLS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Let’s say that you’re tracking someone in the wilderness. You have Hunting at Rank 4 and Endurance at Rank 3. Seems like being able to move quickly over a longer period of time, should help you catch the guys and it does. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you have another Advanced Skill that you think might help you, you can add it for the normal Stress Dice penalty and roll a Stress Dice.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This may seem like it is nearly identical to Preparation, and they are very close. The difference is that Preparation is a general thing that applies to a Skill Check you’re going to make in the future, while using a helper Skill is in the moment and is specific to the scenario. You can use both at the same time, since the help Skill gives a bonus and Preparation gives a reroll.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Skill Mobbing</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For GMs, note that Helper Skills are how you handle Skill Mobbing, where everyone just overpowers a roll by all rolling against it. Instead, only one person rolls and only those with an applicable Advanced Skill and willing to take that Stress Dice add their Rank to help out. </p></td></tr></table><h3>MULTI-TASKING</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Let’s be realistic here: you’re probably going to end up trying to do two things at once, like climbing a wall and doing so quietly.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If that’s the case, you’re going to have to “split” your d20! into smaller dice and assign those to each of the Checks you’re trying to make, because your attention is divided. The total max value of the dice can never exceed 20 but it can be lower than it. The other side will still be rolling full d20!s against you.</p><p style="margin:0px;">So, if you’re climbing a wall and trying to do so quietly, you’d have to make a Climbing and a Move Silently Check. You could split it like so: d12! for Climbing and d8! for Move Silently, or d10! for Climbing and d10! for Move Silently, or d12!+d4! for Move Silently and d4! for Climbing.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Or you could just say “screw being quiet” and roll a d20! for Climbing and take a 0 for Move Silently. In this case, the GM would just roll against your Skill Rank. So, if you choose to ignore Move Silently but have a Rank 4 in it, the GM would roll their dice, and you can hope they don’t roll higher than 4.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Either way, besides this, it works like a normal Check</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Helping Others</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">It feels good to help people and Bonfire is all about group cooperation. The fighter helps the skill monkey survive combat and the skill monkey helps the fighter not look like an idiot while doing detective work.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">And how you help other characters will really depend on the situation. Perhaps your Preparation can be used to help another person hide or perhaps you have a bit of knowledge that they don’t.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Really, this will be done to what feels right in the moment but this note is here to draw attention to someone helping you as an Asset and someone adding their Rank to yours with a Helper Skill, and how they’re different. </p><p style="margin:0px;">And the difference is time. If you have plenty of time to coach someone while they’re climbing a cliff face, you’d be an Asset and nobody would take a Stress Die.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But if you’re being chased by the guards and it’s a matter of seconds or minutes, you’d add a Helper Skill and both of you would need to take the Stress Die.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that if the skill monkey is also trying to climb the cliff face and coach as they go, that would be considered a d10! worth of effort for Multi-Tasking, though you don’t have to actually roll to see if you help. </p></td></tr></table><h3>PREPARATION</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Preparation is anything your character does to help a specific Skill Check that will be made in the future (even if that future is 2 seconds from now). Note that this doesn't have to be a Check you make: it can also apply to an ally's Check (if it makes sense).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Usually, these only take a couple of seconds but can vary widely depending on the circumstances. Throwing a rock is a matter of moments while constructing a gilly suit will take a lot longer.</p><p style="margin:0px;">As long as there is time, there is no chance of failure or, if the players have plenty of time, Preparation just happens. Mark what you did for later in the Skill Challenge.</p><p style="margin:0px;">However, if there is a time crunch or a chance of failure, Preparation works like a normal Skill Check.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Either way, you only get one Prep Check per Advanced Skill that applies for each upcoming Check, unless you have Assets but remember that they do take time.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">That means that if you know you're going to have to make a jump, you can use Acrobatics to stretch, Endurance to do a few practice sprints to the edge, and Sports (long jumping) to remember techniques all to prep for the same Jump check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When you redeem Preparation that you’ve readied, you can reroll one of the dice that was rolled for the Check. This means either the base dice or the difficulty dice for either you or the Obstacle.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Planning & Action Phases</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;">While it isn’t entirely black and white, it’s helpful to think of Challenges as composing two phases: planning and action; the laying out the plan and then the heist.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Planning is gathering intel, getting your team and equipment together, and planning your route of attack. This is where you’ll use Preparation, Taking Your Time, and Assets mostly.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Action phase is when you’ll be doing a lot of the Checks and Stress, as well as equipment and companions - using what you learned in the Prep Phase to help you get through the sticky parts.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But don’t get too hung up on separating these ideas though. Even during the heist, you might find it worth your time to sit on your heels and take your time while doing some Preparation as there will almost certainly be problems that crop up that you need to adjust to.</p></td></tr></table><h3>RUSHING IT</h3><p style="margin:0px;">On the flipside, if you’re in a hurry to get the job down, you can just rush it. This subtracts 50% from the estimated time but gives you a -5. Like Taking Your Time, this can be done multiple times in a row to half the time again but it also increases the penalty by 1.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Failures don’t consider this -3 while determining the extent of your failure and success means you bought yourself some more time: removing the amount you succeed by, with the -3, from the Failure on one of the Obstacles.</p><h3>TAKING YOUR TIME</h3><p style="margin:0px;">The other thing that you can do is take your time and really try and do the job well. Doubling the time for your Check gives you a +6. This can be done multiple times in a row to gain a further bonus but each time lowers the bonus by 1, down to +0. Regardless of how long you take your time, you always only roll 1 Stress Dice.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if it would take you 15 minutes to search a room, you could take 30 minutes instead and get a +6, or 60 minutes for a total of +11 ( 6 + 5 ).</p><h3>WAITING IT OUT</h3><p style="margin:0px;">By doing nothing, you can calm your nerves and let who you’re facing do the same. This can be by either finding a shadow to hunker down in or finding a spot in the wall where you can rest while climbing.</p><p style="margin:0px;">Using this tool allows you to half the current Active penalty. You can also take points from that Active penalty and add them to the Failure against that Obstacle, though you can’t push the Obstacle above its Failure Threshold. You do roll 1 Stress Dice either way.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This may or may not work on an inanimate Obstacle but you need to use your best judgement.</p><h1>SKILL DESCRIPTIONS</h1><tr

Textures should also play a major factor in not just how tough the check is but also how many checks need to be made for a given wall.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, if there’s a wall, where the base is stone at a 45% slant for 20 ft, then it moves to close knit stones for another 40 ft, and then finally to a wood overhang for just 5 ft, and then to a wooden wall for 10 ft, there would be 4 Climbing checks in this order: Trivial, Challenging (Average for base but because it’s 40 ft, it gets bumped up 1), Challenging, and Easy.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DISARM TRAP</strong> It takes nerves of steel to be able to cut the right wire or trip the trap in such a way that the least bad thing happens</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Disarming a trap takes a base of 30 minutes if you don’t want to just set it off. If you’re in a hurry, you can half that time but you increase the difficult by 1 each time you do so. So, reducing the time to 7 minutes, would bump a Trivial trap up to Average in difficulty.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A failure indicates that you set the trap off accidentally.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ENDURANCE</strong> Through training, a character can push his body past the limits of his base physical ability. The Rank of this Skill is the number of seconds between taking damage while Running or Sprinting.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If a character is not trained specifically in this Advanced Skill, default to their Athletics Skill Suite Rank.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ESCAPE ARTIST</strong> This allows the character to escape bonds and restrictions and is always rolled opposed, either against the Rope Use skill of the person who tied them or against the quality of the manacles or binds the person was put in.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The character can make a straight Average check, not to break the bounds or get free, but to instead move his body to an advantageous position.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>JUMPING</strong> You need to cover a distance without touching the ground: jump.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> For every point you scored under what you needed, you travel either 2 ft horizontally or 1 ft vertically. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Jumping from a stand still is an Average check, while doing so with a running start is an Easy check. Add 1 to your roll for every Level of Fatigue your character has.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SPORT (specific)</strong> This covers the actually playing of a specific sport as well as an in-depth knowledge of the game’s rules and famous players and techniques.

This involves being able to feel your way along and compensate for creaks.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is always an opposed check vs any potentially listener’s Listening, with a failure indicating that the listener has heard something suspicious, though the person attempting Move Silently may not be aware that they were detected. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SWIMMING</strong> This skill allows a character to not drown in water. Without at least basic training in this skill, a character can’t attempt to swim with simply an Athletics check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The difficulty of the check is determined by the water (or other liquid, I don’t judge) you’re attempting to swim in, though simply trying to float on your back and letting the current take you reduces the difficulty by 2, though it is risky because you could get pulling into an aquifer and drowned that way or get pulled over a waterfall.</p><h3>LORE SKILL SUITE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This suite covers general knowledge, which is mostly academic in nature. Most of it is pretty heavy stuff but the basics are second nature or stuff that’s been picked up here and there.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ADMINISTRATION</strong> While they’ll never inspire the awe or respect that other leaders do, people who oversee the day to day functions of an organization keep the lights on so that others can make the speeches.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Administrators can make an Average skill check to gain a clue about an item the party might need on their adventure, or a Challenging one to retroactively remember that they did buy an item back at the market for just such an occasion.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each of these checks they make increases the difficulty of the next one by 1 step.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ARCANA</strong> The science of magic is an oft studied but little understood branch of Lore that requires a deep knowledge of the nature of the Painted World.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> With this skill, someone can identify a spell, point out needed regents and processes for ritual castings, detect if something is magical, or even detect if a spell has been cast in an area, and have a chance of finding out what it was.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> All of these, except for the last two, are Average checks, with detecting whether or not a spell was cast in an area is Trivial + 1 for every day since the casting, or to detect what specific spell it was, Challenging + 1 for every day since the casting.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HISTORY</strong> Everyone knows certain large events, but few can tie those events into an overarching narrative and understand their effects on later events.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The History skill allows a character to not just recall events but also to link them to the present day, to certain traditions and rituals of a culture, or the behavior of certain members of a culture, giving insight on how to proceed.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LANGUAGE (specific)</strong> A character receives this skill for free in their native tongue at double their Rank in Lore and it allows them to speak and be understood by others with skill in that language.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Checks are only made when timing is critical, such as communication in a battle, or when understanding is key, such as when debating foreign policy.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If one of the characters is in a Social Conflict with another in a tongue that’s not their native one, that person can only bring in as many Characteristic Die per round as he has Ranks in that Language.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Additionally, when two native speakers are in a Conflict, the one with the higher Language Rank gains Leverage (see Applicable Skills under the Leverage Advance Rule in <strong>Chapter 9: Social</strong> ). In case of tie, nothing happens.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Lore Skill Suite can’t be used in place of a Language Check for tongues you don’t know unless you have the Language Skill in a related Language. Using a real world example, someone with the Language (Swedish) Advanced Skill couldn’t use the Lore Skill Suite to understand a person with Language (French) but could use it when talking to someone with Language (Norwegian) or Language (Danish). </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LAW (culture)</strong> This skill covers the intricacies of the legal system, including landmark rules and common punishments for common crimes. A character can make their case or find loopholes to exploit the legal system.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A character’s Lore skill can only be used to substitute in for their native culture but not others. If the character does wish to branch out, his mastery of Law for that culture starts at 0, as he must learn everything from the ground up. Diving more into his own culture’s laws (buying this Advanced Skill for his culture) uses the Lore skill as base, as per usual.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LITERACY (language)</strong> Unlike other skills, this skill can’t be attempted unless you’ve specifically bought this Advanced Skill and it’s mastery starts at 0. That’s right; every character starts illiterate.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This skill allows a character to read and write in a language’s alphabet, giving them the power to pen books and poems, or passive aggressive notes.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MATHEMATICS</strong> While this may seem like just a skill that allows you to be able to juggle figures and add totals and calculate the area of a circle like a huge nerd, Mathematics has a more practical use: correctly guessing distances.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While you can try to eyeball how far away something is, an Average Mathematics check allows you to do rough calculations, giving you the ability to know exactly what penalty you’re going to get for using a ranged weapon or who’s going to be affected by the Area of Effect of a spell you’re going to cast.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MEDICINE</strong> With proper treatment and nursing, a wound that would lay you out for weeks, may only keep you down for a couple of days. This skill involves the knowledge of long term care, when bandages should be changed, which poultices will have the greatest effect, and what minor surgeries need to be performed.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character with this skill can make a Check for a wounded person, added the Severity of any Wounds that he's treating to the opposing roll. So, if a person has a 5, 3, and 8 Severity Wound, he can make a Medicine Check vs d20+16 or he can choose not to treat the 8 Severity Wound and make a vs d20!+8. Success means that the person can take 1 day off the healing time for that Wound every time it drops a Severity.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, a success against a 5 Severity Wound means that is was treated properly and takes 10 days to completely heal ( 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 ) instead of the normal 15.</p><p style="margin:0px;">You may also increase the Difficulty modifier by half again as much - if you succeed, you take 2 days off per Severity. So, if you're against a d20!+9, you can make it a d20!+14 ( 9 + ( 9 / 2 ) ) for that bonus.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Additionally, a Check vs the a Poison, Toxin, or Disease's Lethality allows character to reroll their save.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MONSTER CRAFT</strong> This Advanced Skill is under both the Lore and Survival Skill Suite but still counts as 1 skill, so you don’t have to buy it twice - they share their Rank. It simply represents the different ways that each Skill Suite approaches the craft.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Monster Craft gives you insight into the creatures that roam the Middle Realm. Starting with something simple, such as their name, and the progressively learning more and more about them, such as they’re are fundamentally two different types of Incorporeal Undead or that you can convince Demons to do things if you win a Conflict with them.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The knowledge should be fairly general - weaknesses or where they draw their power from, so it will never reveal anything meta such as what the monster’s attack or Vitality is but it can let you know if the creature is known for having a lot of Vitality or is good at hitting.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each Monster Craft check starts as an Average Skill Check and answers one question the player has on a success but each successive check on the same monster increases the difficulty by 2. On top of this, for rare creatures or hard questions, the GM may up the Difficulty as she feels is appropriate.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NATURE</strong> This area of study covers the topography of the Middle Realm. It’s forests and rock formations and biomes. It helps predict whether or not it’s going to rain or whether the next summer is going to be a hot one.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Predicting what’s coming in the next hour is a Trivial check, with the difficulty increasing by 1 for each time you double the prediction window. So, detecting the weather in the next 2 hours is Easy, while doing so in the next 16 hours is a Hard check.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RELIGION (cult)</strong> This skill acquaints the character with a knowledge of cults, their common Covenants and Miracles, as well as their hierarchies, means of advancement and important members.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> It also allows a character to gain a knowledge of their rituals and sacrifices, as well as the taboos of their clergy and how to appease their heavenly messengers and avenging angels.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The Religion Skill is taken for a single Covenant, but can purchased independently for different Covenants.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A character adds the tens digit of this skill to their chance of gaining Favor when making sacrifices to the god of that cult.</p><h3>STREETWISE SKILL SUITE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This suite covers knowledge that a character might pick on the street or in the school of hard knocks. While Lore is book smart, Streetwise is street smart.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CURRENT AFFAIRS</strong> A character with this skill is well informed about the day to day affairs of regional powers and men and woman of importance, their dealings and alliances, as well as their hatreds. He can pick out celebrities and know how and why someone got rich and famous. They can also use this skill to guess the Honor category of someone by watching how people react to them.</p><table style="width:330px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Deception Check </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Penalty</td><td>Level Of Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>0</td><td>White Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-1</td><td>Lie Of Omission</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-2</td><td>Mostly True Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-3</td><td>Half Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-5</td><td>Mostly False Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-8</td><td>Absolute Lie</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-13</td><td>Absolute Lie With Easy Evidence Against It</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DECEPTION</strong> This covers all sort of deception, where you want the person to believe opposite the truth, or, to put it simply, when you want to lie to them.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The level of difficulty to pull off a lie is based on how much of what you’re saying isn’t the truth, strictly speaking. This is always opposed by either the other character’s Deception or Perception but only if the character has reason to suspect that you’re lying to them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Even if you succeed, this isn’t a permanent way of changing their mind. New evidence presented to that person may cause them to rethink their opinion on what you tried to sell them so be careful about what falsehoods you spin.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FORGERY</strong> Mostly commonly used for creating fake currency, forgery is a skill that allows a character to reproduce something effectively and fool others. This skill acquaints the character with common forging techniques and knowledge with what possible agents will being looked for.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The forger must also have the appropriate corresponding Craft or Trade skill, so he can’t forge coins if he doesn’t have the Metalworking skill, though that’s within reason: a character forging an official passport with one at hand doesn’t need to have Literacy as he can just copy the letters, though he may also need to have Artistry (wood cutting) to create the heraldry on it, but someone trying to forge an official declaration from skratch does need to have the Literacy skill in that language plus Artistry (wood cutting).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Forgery is opposed by Perception, the applicable skill, or Forgery but only if the character looking has reason to suspect there’s something else. A lazy guard probably won’t check your passport too closely right before lunch, but a particularly astute one who’s on the lookout for a promotion will, thus granting him a check. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GAMBLING/GAMING</strong> This skill doesn’t give the character a gift for winning games, just that he knows the rules and knows the odds, which could in turn lead to him winning the game. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INTUITION</strong> The ability to understand people and get where they're coming form can help you figure out what will and won't work with them better. A Trivial Intuition check allows the character to get a feel for how open a person would be to a Conflict over something or what would be definite dealbreakers. It doesn't reveal any of their Characteristics or their strengths as it's more of gut feeling than anything.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each check on the same person increases the Difficulty by 1. To gain this insight, they must either watch them for a total of 3 hours + 1 hour for every additional thing they wish to learn, or talk to them for 10 minutes + 5 minutes for every additional. You can speed up the learning process, but 1 hour or 5 minutes, respectively, but doing so also increases the difficulty by 1. This time doesn't have to be in one sitting or done purposeful and more represents the fact that the person making the check needs to be familiar with the person on some leve.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LISTENING</strong> While Perception handles the other senses, Listening has to deal with your character’s auditory senses. This goes beyond simply hearing something: listening allows the character to know when an otherwise innocuous noise is actually something to pay attention to though it might not always be apparent why at first. </p><table style="width:300px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="3" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Lock Picking </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Lock Penalty</td><td>Base Time</td><td>Time Off</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>0</td><td>1 Minute</td><td>1 Second</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-1</td><td>5 Minutes</td><td>5 Seconds</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-2</td><td>20 Minutes</td><td>30 Seconds</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-3</td><td>30 Minutes</td><td>1 Minute</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-4</td><td>45 Minutes</td><td>5 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-5</td><td>1 Hour</td><td>10 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>Per -3 After</td><td>Add. +15 Minutes</td><td>10 Minutes</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LOCK PICKING</strong> It takes a lot more know how then you might think to pick a lock. The amount of time it takes to pick any lock is based on your skill level and the quality of the lock. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Subtract the Time Off x how much you succeeded your check by from the Base Time.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PERCEPTION</strong> This covers four of the five senses that a character has: sight, touch, taste, and smell. Technically, your character is always receiving inputs from these senses but Perception helps filter out the most important ones. Can he detect if there are orcs in the nearby bush? Can she taste the hidden poison in her drink before she swallows? These are all Perception checks</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Like Listening, sometimes Perception will help the character notice something that may be important, even if it’s not obvious why it’s grabbing your attention.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SLEIGHT OF HAND</strong> This skill covers all things that require you to do quick, delicate movements with your fingers. This may be slipping a card up your sleeve, picking a pocket, or doing cat’s cradle while bored.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRAP FINDING</strong> This actually covers a lot more than simple detecting trip wires or arrow holes in a dungeon. This can detect pits and snares, as well as buttons disguised as bricks or switches hidden as sconces.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A character can sweep an entire room with a Hard check but a character may be awarded a modifier secretly by the GM if they point out 2 or 3 spots they want to pay extra close attention to if one or more of those places actually houses the trap. Obviously, you don’t earn that modifier if you just name everything in the room and the more specific you are with what you’re searching, the higher that modifier should be.</p><h3>SURVIVAL SKILL SUITE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This suite covers everything that a character might need to survive in the wild; Knowledge of what plants to eat and the skills to hunt and breed animals.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BOTANY</strong> This gives a knowledge of what the herbs used in cooking, alchemy, and medicine look like in their natural environment and it allows you to identify their common uses.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Mostly, this is used for detecting poisonous plants, which is a Trivial check, but someone with the Medicine skill can also find any local plants that might help him in his cures with an Average check, lowering his Medicine check by 1 if succeeds.</p><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Camouflaging Objects </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Penalty</td><td>Size</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>0</td><td>Fine</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-1</td><td>Diminutive</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-2</td><td>Tiny</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-3</td><td>Small</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-5</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-8</td><td>Large</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-13</td><td>Huge</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-21</td><td>Gargatuan</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CAMOUFLAGE</strong> This involves more than just ducking behind a crate or sliding into the shadow of a doorway; the skill of camouflage represents a character’s ability to blend into their surroundings, given enough time and patience. It also always them to help others hide more effectively as well. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Assuming that the character has time and equipment to do so, a character gains his skill percentage in Camouflage to his Hiding temporary. Additionally, under the same conditions, he can also give this bonus to other’s Hiding checks.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When used to hide something in plain sight, like a cart, building, or weapon, he may roll a check based on its size.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FIRE BUILDING</strong> Against the cold, lonely nights out in the wild, there is only the fertility symbols you carve for yourself and the roar of the fire. This skill allows you to build one of those things: the fire.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Under normal conditions, it takes about 30 minutes and a Trivial check to setup and light a fire, assuming you don’t have to go far out of your way to find the wood.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FIRST AID</strong> This gives the character a crude understanding of battlefield medicine: making splints and staunching wounds.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A character with this skill can make a Check for a person wounded in that last 30 minutes, added the Severity of any Wounds that he's treating to the opposing roll. So, if a person has a 5, 3, and 8 Severity Wound, he can make a First Aid Check vs d20+16 or he can choose not to treat the 8 Severity Wound and make a vs d20!+8. Success means that the person can take 1 level of Severity off those Wounds. So a 5 Severity Wound drops immediately to a 4 Severity Wound. You cannot go back and do a Check for a Wound that you skipped.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You have 30 minutes to preform First Aid Checks for a person, which each Wound taking 3 minutes to see to, if appliable. You may also increase the Difficulty modifier by half again as much - if you succeed, you hit 2 points of damage. So, if you're against a d20!+9, you can make it a d20!+14 ( 9 + ( 9 / 2 ) ) to heal 2 points of damage. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HANDLE ANIMAL (specific)</strong> This skill deals with the handling and care of a specific animal, from birth to the slaughter house. It also deals with training and common illnesses to make sure the stock is healthy and viril.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The base price of this skill is calculated towards domesticated animals. If the player wishes to learn how to deal with wild animals, this skill costs thrice as much to purchase.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HIDING</strong> This allows a character to make the most of a situation or environment to cloak themselves against prying eyes. This is always opposed by Perception, with the difficulty determined by the area. Character can also use this to instantly get an idea of how well they can hide in the given space.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MONSTER CRAFT</strong> This skill is the same as the Monster Craft under the Lore Skill Suite. Look there for details on it.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NAVIGATION</strong> Either using the stars or the position of the moons and sun, this character can track their way even through the most untamed wilderness without getting lost. It also allows them to tell the time.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Without proper equipment, a character can only give rough estimations of where they are, anchored on larger geographic feature (like mountains or rivers but not towns or roads) to the nearest 10 miles.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SCAVENGING</strong> There’s a gift in high speed appraisal. This is often used by those picking over battlefields for anything they could sell, but it’s also found a niche with adventurers who use it to find food and sustainance while traveling away from civilization.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> A Trivial check tells a character which of two things considered is worth more. This can’t be used for coinage, but can be any other type of good. It also gives the character an idea of whether broken equipment can be reasonably salvaged.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This doesn’t give even a ballpark of what anything is worth but it only takes a few seconds of consideration. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SNARING</strong> This teaches the character how to properly create and place snares to trap smaller wildlife. It also gives some cursory knowledge on the best places to put them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A successful Trivial check nets 1 lbs of usable game meat at the end of the day, with the amount you can catch increasing by 1 for each additional difficulty.</p><table style="width:250px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Hunting Check </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Modifiers</td><td>Condition</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-8</td><td>Raining</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>3</td><td>Still Muddy Ground</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Heavy Foliage</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-3</td><td>A Day Difference</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-5</td><td>A Week Difference</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-1</td><td>For Each Day After A Week</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Each Person In The Persued Party</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HUNTING</strong> Most of the time, you’re not going to down your query in one go, and so the hunt is on as your watch for subtle signs of their passing. While this skill was originally used to hunt wildlife, it has been repurposed by wardens and bounty hunters trying to capture the most dangerous game. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The base for a Hunting check is Average difficulty, however, a lot of different factors play into a hunt. Each condition either raises or lowers the difficulty by the noted amount. These are not all the conditions that come into play but it should give you a good base line.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> On a failure, the Tracker loses the trail for a number of days equal to the amount they failed by. They must double back and can try a second check after the time elapsed to see if they’ve found the trail again. Should they fail the second time, they’ve completely lost the trail.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If your query is actively trying to hide their tracks, it becomes opposed by the query’s Hunting skill. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>USE ROPE</strong> Covering all kinds of knots and bindings, the Use Rope skill is pretty self explanatory, though it should be noted that you can also use this skill to get a sense of the tensile strength of a rope or how much you’re going to need for a certain job.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> To keep your players on their toes, I suggest you make the check, not when they tie the knot, but when it’s tested. </p><h3>TACTIC SKILL SUITE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Combat isn’t just about raw physical power, but more about how it’s directed and used. This Skill Suite deals with logistics and making the most out of what you have.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COMBAT STYLE (style)</strong> By studying the best tactics and how to fight in certain circumstances, a warrior can take advantage of his surroundings and combat styles emerge. Combat Styles can be anything but involve to parts: a situation and a metric. This situation is when the Combat Style is most effective. For instance, it can be “in the forest”, “fighting on rooftops”, “being outnumbered”, “being in a duel”, “fighting while prone”, etc.. Really anything (as long as your GM approves). The second part of the Combat Style is the metric is applied to. This can be anything you could normally specialize in. Both the situation and metric are selected at the time of purchase and cannot be changed.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If the situation is applicable, the character receives a +1 to that metric for every 2 Ranks of that skill he’s obtained.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So a character with the Combat Skill (unarmed fighting, attack) at 5 who gets into a tavern brawl gets a +2 to attack as long as he doesn’t draw his weapon and simply uses fisticuffs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Having a high Rank in Tactics doesn't automatically give you Combat Style bonuses under all circumstances and buying this skill for the first time starts it off at Rank 0, instead of the Tactic Suite's Rank. </p><table style="width:200px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Distraction Check </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Penalty</td><td>Time</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>0</td><td>1 Second</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-2</td><td>1d2 Seconds</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-3</td><td>1d3 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-5</td><td>1d4 Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-8</td><td>1d4! Minutes</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-13</td><td>1d6! Minutes</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DISTRACTION</strong> More than simply yelling “hey, look” at someone, the art of distraction is the art of holding people’s attention.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The amount of time that someone is delayed is based on the difficulty of the check and how bent on their current activity they are.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The time given below is the time between checks, however, each successive check gets 1 difficulty harder, with the same result. So, distracting someone for 1d3 minutes the first time is Average, but the next 1d3 minutes you’re trying to hold their attention is Challenging. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This skill is less effective when the person knows they’re in immediate danger. In this case, as long as they’re not actively engaged in melee with someone, the time is reduced to equivalent amount of seconds. So, a successful Challenging check only delays someone for 1d4 seconds instead. Each successive check gets 2 difficulties harder in these cases.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LEADERSHIP</strong> The difference between a leader and an administrator is that the latter gets stuff done and the former gets others to get stuff done but hooking into what they believe and how they view themselves. Assuming you have a willing audience, you may make an Average Leadership skill check vs a social characteristic you think the person or group might have. If you succeed the check and they have the characteristic you’re looking for (or close enough - you don’t have to be exact), you increase their Morale by a number of points equal to the maximum value of one of the dice of that characteristic. So, a 3d4 Trait will only net 4 points of Morale.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can increase the number of characteristics you’re aiming for by increasing the difficulty of the check by a like number, but the audience only gains the bonus from the largest of the characteristics.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>QUARTER MASTERING</strong> There’s an art to packing and making sure that everyone is well fed and prepared. If a the quartermaster is using a personal container of any kind, he adds 2S for each Rank he has in this Skill. Otherwise, he adds 1S per Rank. This also applies to any person he packs for. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RALLY</strong> When manure hits the windmill, no speeches or grand narratives will keep a person from bolting. Only the cold will of a competent commander can keep a battle from becoming a route. A captain who successfully makes a Check for someone who is currently over their Stress Threshold, heals that person a number of Stress equal to his Rank. This is opposed by the enemy captain, if appliable, and each Check against the same target increases the Difficulty by 1, regardless of whether it was successful or not.</p><table style="width:250px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Recruiting Check </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Modifiers</td><td>Location</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5</td><td>Captial (pop +200,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>Large City (pop +100,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>Medium City (pop +15,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>0</td><td>Small City (pop +8,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-1</td><td>Large Town (pop +1,000)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-3</td><td>Medium Town (pop +500)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>-5</td><td>Small Town (pop +20)</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>-8</td><td>Wilderness</td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RECRUITING</strong> Knowing where to find the right person is a crucial skill for any long term expedition. A character with this skill can find a random person willing to hire on with a Trivial check in a number of days equal to their roll.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Now, finding specialists or someone with a certain skill is another matter. Every additional criteria adds 1 level of difficulty to the search.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Where you’re looking also makes a difference, as well.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This doesn’t guarantee that the person found will take the job or doesn’t have some serious issues, like a crippling fear of dogs: it only guarantees that they have the skills you’re looking for and that they’re somewhat interested in being hired on. Pay and comfort make a lot of difference to a prospective hire.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RIDING</strong> This skill teaches a character how to maintain their stability while on horseback and making them capable of feats of equine prowess.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The bonuses for this Skill are varied and many with the specifics spelled out in <strong>Chapter 10: Combat</strong> under the Mounted Combat section so they won't be listed here. Seriously, go check it out.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SIGNALLING</strong> This is the knowledge of how to communicate over long distances, either using semaphore, smoke signals, signal lamps, or horn blowing.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When using this means of communication, each side rolls a check based on how complicated the message is and how quickly they need to send it. Signalling is an ad hoc language with no grammatical rules or complicated tenses and so even at the best of times, only simple messages can be sent.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WARFARE</strong> The Warfare skill hands directing troops on the battlefield, weighing options and devising plans on the fly. Those with this skill can roll it to temporarily pause combat to ask one question and receive one answer from a specific member of the party, or to simply tell them something. On top of this, you can also use this, out of combat, to confer with players who’re characters are not present in the scene.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Checks start at Trivial but increase by 1 difficulty each time they’ve been rolled that combat.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Warfare also has additional benefits and uses that will be outlined in Crowns of Fire, the kindgom management and mass combat supplement for Bonfire Advanced.</p><h3>TRADES SKILL SUITE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This suite covers the crafting and creating skills. While there are a wide array and breathe of professions, this list is pared down to those areas of knowledge where the common man and the adventurer overlap in their needs.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>APPRAISAL (specific)</strong> It’s wise to know what something is worth before selling and buying it. This skill handles that and is taken for a specific type of good, such as books & scrolls, livestock, jewelry, armors & armor, and so on.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If a character has the appropriate skill covering the item he’s looking to sell/purchase, he can get within her roll, expressed at a percentage, of what the item is currently worth, with the Check based on how common the item is and how closely it relates to his skill’s focus.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Additionally, the character should get a bonus if he has any skill that’s applicable to the thing he’s purchasing.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ARTISTRY (specific)</strong> While some many not find the Fine Arts a worthy way to spend time, others may disagree. Artistry covers all artistic endeavors, including painting, sculpture, embroidery and anything else that is done for art’s sake.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COOKING/BAKING</strong> On the road, a hot meal can count for a lot. A character who has a hot meal subtracts 1 day off the amount of time it takes to heal their Stress per Stress, so, they’re able to heal 15 Stress in 120 days, instead of 105.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> On top of this, a character can prep otherwise unpalatable or poisonous food in such a way as to make the most of it, though it is a Challenging check to do so, meaning they can stretch rations for longer.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Unless the character is trying to prep a feast worthy of His Imperial Majesty, basic daily cooking only requires a Trivial check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CRAFT (specific)</strong> This skill covers any skill that makes something that isn’t noted here, such as carpentry, tailoring, basket weaving, pottery, etc.. The GM may adjust the price for a particularly difficult to master study.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LEATHERWORKING</strong> From the moment it leaves the beast to the moment the final touches are finished, leatherworking handles the process of making and crafting works from the hides of animals, including skinning and tanning. </p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MAINTAINCE</strong> The skill of tinkers and adventurers, this gives the person a general knowledge of easy and ad hoc fixes that can be done on the fly. The level of difficulty in repairing something is equal to the total penalty it gives, rounded up to the nearest dice size.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So repairing a spear with a -1 to Attack and Damage is Trivial (d4!), while repairing one with a -3 to Attack and Damage is Easy (d6!). </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>METALWORKING</strong> This covers the process of changing crude ore into a beautiful weapon, armor, or decorative piece. It also covers the construction and repair of more mundane things, like plows, but if you’re picking this skill up, I doubt you’re doing it to corner the farmer’s market.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MUSICIAN (specific)</strong> This covers the mastery of specific instrument, including singing. At the end of the day, the dulcet tones of a neatly played mandolin can ease the ache of a long day. A character who hears someone play an instrument subtracts 1 day off the amount of time it takes to heal their Stress per Stress, so, they’re able to heal 15 Stress in 10 days, instead of 15.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This doesn’t stack with others playing, however, and does no good if you’re in a stressful situation, like being hunted.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Unless the character is trying to serenade a queen, basic daily ditties only require a Trivial check.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PERFORMANCE</strong> This skill covers everything from making your case before a court or a stirring speech before charging into battle. On a success, anyone listening gains a temporary d4 Devotion to what the performer wants: whether that’s themselves or an organization or a case. If the Devotion already exists, the size is temporarily increased. Additionally, the Devotion dice size can be increased 1 for every extra level of difficulty the orator passes their check by.</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PERSUASION</strong> You may think that the truth is powerful enough to carry your argument but you can be beat out by a master of deception. Persuasion is the skill of rhetoric and formulating the truth in such a way that make it the most convincing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The level of difficulty to convince someone is how much evidence you can supply to back up your arguments. This is opposed by Deception or Persuasion but only if someone is trying to actively trying to deceive or convince the same person as you.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Even if you succeed, this isn’t a permanent way of changing a person’s mind. Others may lie more effectively than you can tell the truth and that may cause them to rethink their opinion on what you tried to sell them. </p><table style="width:500px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="2" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Persuasion Check </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Factor</td><td>Level Of Evidence</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>13</td><td>Amply Evidence Right At Hand, Backed Up By First Hand Experiance</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>8</td><td>Amply Evidence Availible But Not At Hand With Conviction, Backed Up By First Hand Experiance</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5</td><td>Some Evidence With Conviction With First Hand Experiance</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>3</td><td>Some Evidence With Conviction With Only Rumors</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>2</td><td>No Evidence But Conviction, Or Vice Versa.
