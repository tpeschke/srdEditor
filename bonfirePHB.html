        <h5>Character Creation</h5>
        <h1>1. ROLL STAT SCORES</h1>
        <p style="margin:0px;"> Your character has 6 attributes that define your character physically and mentally.
            These are Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intellect (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma
            (Cha). More on details are found in <strong>Chapter 2: Stat Scores.</strong></p>
        <p style="margin:0px;"> Roll 3d6 for each of these Abilities to generate that score.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This should result in something similar to this:</p>
        <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Str: 13</strong></p>
        <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Dex: 7</strong></p>
        <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Con: 10</strong></p>
        <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Int: 14</strong></p>
        <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Wis: 11</strong></p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Cha: 6</strong></p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Bonfire is specifically balanced for you to roll 3d6 in order, with 10 being
            the average result but you’ll have the chance to modify these later so don’t worry too much if you have low
            scores.</p>
        <h1>2. RECIEVE CrP</h1>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Alright, you have your scores. Now it’s time to decide whether or not if you
            can reroll them. At this point you’re also going to determine how many Creation Points (or CrP, for short)
            you’ll start with. These CrP will be spent on modifying your character; buying them their skills and
            increasing their Scores. They may also be spent on rerolls at certain steps.</p>
        <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
            <tr>
                <th></th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p style="margin:0px;"> If you have no score over 13, or 2 under 6, you may choose to reroll for
                        free. Your character just didn’t have it in him to go adventuring.</p>
                    <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If that’s not the case and you still want to reroll your stats, you
                        can but you receive 0 CrPs to work with and you’re stuck with your second set of Scores.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Even still, you may want to switch your stats around. This may be because you
            have almost the right stats but you have a specific character concept in mind. For instance, using the
            example stats in Step 1, your party may need a diplomatic character more than a strong character. In this
            case, it would really help to swap Strength and Charisma.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px;"> You can freely switch around your stats as need but, in that case, you only receive 25
            CrPs.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px;"> If you switch only 4 of your stats, you receive 50 CrPs.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px;"> If you switch 2, you receive 75 CrPs.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And if you keep your stats the way they are, with no changes, you gain 100 CrPs
            to work with.</p>
        <h1>3. SELECT RACE</h1>
        <p style="margin:0px;"> Your character’s race will change how they interact with the world and what they’ll be
            good and bad at so pick carefully.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Details are found in <strong>Chapter 3: Races</strong> so go there and pick one
            and come back here when you’re done.</p>
        <h1>4. CHOOSE YOUR ARCHETYPES</h1>
        <p style="margin:0px;"> Your character’s class is made of two Archetypes combined.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You choose a Primary and a Secondary Archetype and pay the price in CrP for
            both based on your race’s Archetype Cost section. Descriptions of the different Archetypes are found in
            <strong>Chapter 4: Archetypes</strong> along with more details on how to combined them.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve chosen to reroll your stats and have no CrPs to work with,
            congratulations, you’re now in CrP debt and need to make it up by the end of Character Creation.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You must select two Archetypes before going further.</p>
        <h1>5. RECORD ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h1>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is more for Caster Archetypes, as they’ll head over to <strong>Chapter 12:
                The Weird</strong> to roll their starting spells but now is the time to record any free Skills, or
            Masteries you obtained free from your class choice, as well as Class Abilities</p>
        <h1>6. ROLLS FLAWS</h1>
        <p style="margin:0px;"> All heroes have flaws. That’s what makes them relatable and human (even if they’re an
            orc). Character Flaws earn you additional CrP, which is great. Flaws can also be used in social situations
            to further the story.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> For a list of Flaws flip to <strong>Chapter 5: Flaws.</strong></p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve gone into CrP debt and you’re not out of it by the end of this stage,
            you’ll need to go back and reselect your Archetypes so that you are or go back to you starting set of stats
            and begin Character Creation all over again with them.</p>
        <h1>7. ADJUST STATS</h1>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Now, it is time to do the final adjustments to your stats. While not your final
            adjustments: you'll have a chance to increase them again level up.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The price to increase a Stat is the Stat + 10. So, to get a Stat to 9 from 8,
            it would cost 18 CrP.</p>
        <h1>8. CALCULATE CHARACTER VITALS</h1>
        <p style="margin:0px;"> Now it’s time to calculate your character’s Honor and Vitality.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px;"> These 2 things, along with Stress are important parts of the game and serve as the prime
            mechanics when running a Bonfire game. If you’re not familiar with them head over to <strong>Chapter 6:
                Character Vitals.</strong></p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This chapter will also give you an overview of the character sheet that you’ll
            get more acquainted with later. </p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve already played Bonfire before, here’s a cheat sheet for calculating
            those things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Honor: This is determined by your “Starting Honor” listed under your Charisma</li>
            <li>Vitality: This is Con score + Primary Archetype’s Vitality Die + Vitality Size Modifier from race,
                divided into 4 Categories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Don't forget that you get a bonus to your CrP from the Honor of your last
            character. If this is your first character, you instead get 25 CrP. Enjoy.</p>
        <h1>9. MASTERIES & SKILLS</h1>
        <p style="margin:0px;"> Masteries and Skills are additional areas of expertise that your character has obtained
            above his or her race and class.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> All three cost CrP. Prices and descriptions can be found in <strong>Chapter 8:
                Skills.</strong></p>
        <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
            <tr>
                <th>
                    <h2 class="sidebarTitle">Out of Order Character Creation</h2>
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’re a little bit more familiar with Bonfire Character
                        creation, these last steps (step 9, 10, and 11) can be taken in any order you’d like, even
                        skipping back and forth between them.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h1>10. DEFINE SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS</h1>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your character is more than just raw stats, skills, and abilities. At this
            step, you’re going to define more about who they see themselves as and how others perceive them by defining
            their Traits, Passions, Goals, and Devotions. Jump to <strong>Chapter 9: Social.</strong></p>
        <h1>11. BUY EQUIPMENT</h1>
        <p style="margin:0px;"> Every character starts with a kit of gear, which has a list of per purchased starting
            gear as well as an extra bit of starting cash they you can spend on additional things. Proceed to
            <strong>Chapter 11: Equipment</strong> for a full list of available kits and gear you can pick up.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You may also cash in any left over CrP for sp at 1 CrP for 10 sc, but you don’t
            have to. You can save your CrP to spend later at your level up.</p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After purchasing your equipment, adjust your Encumbrance. Don’t forget that
            armor and shields will also modify this.</p>
        <h1>12. TRANSFER TO CHARACTER SHEET</h1>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Congratulations: you’re on the home stretch! Finish your character off by
            transferring your notes to a fresh character sheet, an example of which, with a break down, is found in
            <strong>Chapter 6: Character Vitals.</strong> You can also find a download for the <a
                href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L8hQ38ZjLbn9E_CDqVb6_rKG-uG_5yGX/view">character sheet here.</a>
        </p>
        <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
            <tr>
                <th>
                    <h2 class="sidebarTitle">Exploding Dice</h2>
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You’ll notice a exclamation mark (!) behind a lot of dice
                        notations. This marks the dice as exploding, which means that should the maximum of that dice is
                        rolled, you get to roll it again, this time with a - 1, and add what you rolled to the total.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin:0px;"> This continues for as long as you roll the maximum dice, however, the - 1
                        always stays a -1 one. </p>
                    <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, if you roll a 3d8! for damage, you get a 5, 8, 8. Since you
                        rolled the maximum value on two of your dice, you roll those dice again, and roll an 8, and 5,
                        giving you a subtotal of 32 ( 5 + 8 + 8 + 8 - 1 + 5 - 1 ) but since you rolled another 8, you
                        get to roll that dice again, and you get a 1, netting you a 0 ( 1 - 1 ).</p>
                    <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are two things you should be aware of: 1d100! explode to a
                        1d20!, while 1d20! explode to a d6!.</p>
                    <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The second thing is that explosion dice don’t add additional dice
                        to the number. So, in the example above, all that damage is only counted as having been done
                        with 3 dice (instead of the 5 that were actually rolled).</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
            <tr>
                <th>
                    <h2 class="sidebarTitle">Dice Size Hierarchy</h2>
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Bonfire plays around a lot with dice sizes, so it’s important to
                        know what dice to grab in those cases.</p>
                    <p style="margin:0px;"> Dice sizes go as follows:</p>
                    <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d2 → d3 → d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12 → d20</p>
                    <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If a d4 is exploding and drops to a d3 or lower, it stops
                        exploding.</p>
                    <p style="margin:0px;"> If the dice size increases past a d20, you’ll add an extra dice starting at
                        a d4. Further dice sizes will increase this smaller dice. This can continue ad nauseum, but no
                        matter how many dice there are, they’re always considered to be rolled on 1 dice.</p>
                    <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, 3d20! + d10! is still considered 1 dice.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h5>Stat Scores</h5>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Stat Scores represent different dimensions of your character and how good their
            baseline is at certain activities. These dimensions are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intellect,
            Wisdom, Charisma.</p>
        <h1>STAT CHECKS</h1>
        <p style="margin:0px;"> There many come a time where a Skill Check doesn’t exactly cover what needs to be
            tested. What skill covers trying to deadlift a boulder or remember a fact about a person? When skills fail
            and it’s simply a raw test of an ability, Stat Checks come into play. </p>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Players making an unopposed ability check roll a d20 and try to get a result
            equal to or under their their stat score. If the check is made at 1/2 the score, they're trying to roll
            equal to or under their score, rounded down. Should they do so, they succeed.</p>
        <h3>OPPOSED CHECKS</h3>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Opposed checks work almost the same. The player rolls a d20! + their relevant
            stat score vs an opposing d20! + any relevant modifiers (such as the boulder being really heavy or only
            their foes relevant stat score). The person with the higher total succeeds.</p>

            <h3>DAMAGE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number is added to your damage whenever your character hits something
                with their fits or uses thrown ranged weapons. It’s the raw, physical force he can put into an object.

            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Dexterity (Dex) is a measure of how agile your character is. Can she dodge
                arrows or can she execute a graceful pirouette? Dexterity is crucial for avoiding blows in combat or
                traps in a hallway.</p>
            <h3>ATTACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Being graceful allows your character to take advantage of openings others
                can’t. This number gets added to all attack rolls your character makes.</p>
            <h3>DEFENCE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you can move quicker than your opponent, you can often get out of harm’s
                way before it becomes a problem. This number gets added to all melee defense rolls your character makes.
            </p>
            <h3>INITIATIVE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Another bonus of being quick on your feet is the ability to get moving
                quicker when manure hits the windmill. This number gets added to your initiative rolls at the beginning
                of combat.</p>

            <h3>SOCIAL DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sometimes your character’s dexterity can play into social situations, such
                as trying to seduce your opponent. This is the die that gets added to your dice pool for Social

            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Constitution (Con) represents your character’s over all health and
                toughness. Can he shrug off the Dancing Death or does he succumb to a head cold? Can she take a solid
                blow in combat and not even blink? These are the things Constitution oversees.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Constitution is the base of your starting Vitality so don’t neglect it.</p>
            <h3>MIN VITALITY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Every other level, a character gains a reroll of their Vitality Die. This number is
                the minimum amount that reroll can be.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, if a Fighter with 15 Constitution gets a 3 on their reroll, they add 4
                to that result to get it to 7. This cannot exceed the amount that can be rolled on your dice. If a
                wizard has a minimum reroll of 7, they will still only get 4 Vitality from their dice.</p>
            <h3>ENCUMB.</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Encumbrance plays a critical role in any fight and represents your character’s
                ability to mentally and physically overcome his weariness and struggle on.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> More on calculating Encumbrance is found in <strong>Chapter 6: Character
                    Vitals.</strong></p>
            <h3>SKILL</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number represents the discount you apply to Skill costs whenever you
                buy a Skill with this as a listed Stat.</p>
            <h3>SOCIAL DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sometimes your character’s constitution can play into social situations,
                such as convincing your opponent she really doesn’t want to fight you. This is the die that gets added
                to your dice pool for Social Conflicts if your Constitution is applicable.</p>

            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Intellect (Int) measures your character’s raw knowledge: how much data can
                he remember? Can she do mathematical calculations or remember who the Elector of Stanitz is? Intellect
                doesn’t help in applying that knowledge but it does give you knowledge to draw on.</p>
            <h3>ATTACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Being able to pinpoint holes in your opponent’s defense allows you to see
                openings that others don’t. A cunning intellect can help land a telling blow. This number is added to
                all attack rolls your character makes. </p>
            <h3>LvL CrP</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A character with a high Intellect is able to grasp concepts and skills
                quicker than others, allowing him to learn more things than others in an equivalent amount of time. This

                Passions.</p>
            <h3>SKILL</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number represents the discount you apply to Skill costs whenever you

            <h3>SOCIAL DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sometimes your character’s intelligence can play into social situations,
                such as convincing someone that you’re right simply because you know more. This is the die that gets
                added to your dice pool for Social Conflicts if your Intellect is applicable.</p>

            <h3>DEFENSE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Having greater body awareness allows you to keep your form tight and your
                limbs out of danger and where they need to be. This coupled with the ability to read your opponent
                allows the wise character to keep from getting hit. This number gets added to all melee defense rolls
                your character makes.</p>
            <h3>ENCUMB.</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The ability to disconnect your mind from the pain and ignore your screaming muscles

            <h3>SKILL</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number represents the discount you apply to Skill costs whenever you

            <h3>SOCIAL DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sometimes your character’s wisdom can play into social situations, such
                knowing exactly what to say to a grieving friend. This is the die that gets added to your dice pool for
                Social Conflicts if your Wisdom is applicable.</p>

            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Charisma (Cha) represents force of personality. Does he bend others to his
                will? Is she the focus of any room she enters? Do people look up to them or what to be him? Charisma is
                not looks or even likeability: it represents this animal magnatism that people follow.</p>
            <h3>FAVOR</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The gods are fickle creatures, bestowing their gifts on some and their ire on
                others, and often switch with the seasons, however, charismatic characters tend to do well for
                themselves.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is the minimum amount of Favor a person gets whenever they roll their
                Devotion die to gain Favor. If this minimum is greater than the die size, you receive the max of that
                dice instead. More information about that is found in <strong>Chapter 13: The Divine.</strong> </p>
            <h3>START HONOR</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Being well thought of allows your character to hold his head high in any
                situation, giving him the edge. This is your character’s starting Honor category. You can find out more
                in <strong>Chapter 6: Character Vitals.</strong></p>
            <h3>MIN HON</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Charismatic people may find themselves on the wrong end of opinion but they
                often don’t find themselves there for long. At the end of each session, if your character’s Honor is
                under this threshold, they jump up to this much Honor. You can find out more in <strong>Chapter 6:
                    Character Vitals.</strong></p>
            <h3>FOLLOWERS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is the total number of Followers your character has to draw on during
                his adventuring career. More on Followers is found in <strong>Appendix 1: GM's Guide.</strong></p>
            <h3>TRAIT POINTS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Characters with strong personalities tend to have a lot of definable
                qualities that allow them to blend into any social group or a few really strong ones that people seem
                drawn to. These points are spent increase the number and/or strength of your character’s Traits.</p>
            <h3>SKILL</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number represents the discount you apply to Skill costs whenever you
                buy a Skill with this as a listed Stat.</p>
            <h3>SOCIAL DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sometimes your character’s charisma can play into social situations, such
                seducing someone. This is the die that gets added to your dice pool for Social Conflicts if your
                Charisma is applicable.</p>
            <h5>Races</h5>
            <h3>A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE HISTORY OF THE MIDDLE REALM</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> In the beginning, the Divines created the Painted World, in which they placed their
                first children. The Painted World was mutable and the source of all magic and there the First Children
                lived happily, beautiful, skilled, and perfect in everyway.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> They were the delight of all the Divines, save one: the trickster Divine, Rostam.
                Rostam quickly grew bored of the First Children and the constant fawning they received from the Divines.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> And so, under the guise of creating servants for the Divines, he created the
                Dwarves. He made the opposite of the First Children - crude, mean, ugly, and incorrigible in the
                extreme. They caused such an uproar in the Higher Realm that the Divines banished them to the Nothing
                beyond the Gate of Heaven, where certain death awaited them in the embrace of non-existent nothing.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The Father of the Dwarves took his people and before passing through the Gate of
                Heaven, slew the giant Ymir, who stood guard there and tossed his body into the Nothing. The All-Father
                and his sons jumped from the Gate and onto Ymir and from his bones they made the Middle Realm; the
                giant’s blood, the oceans and his muscles, the earth.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> There they lived a profane life, in defiance of the Divines. With the protection of
                the Bones of Ymir, the dwarves were able to avoid the direct displeasure of the Divines and so the
                Divines needed to think of different ways to reach them in their holds.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> They created the Bonfire, links to the Higher Realm, through which they sent the
                unthinking evils of the world through but the dwarves repulsed them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> And so they created their Second Children, avenging angels robed in flesh, to travel
                through the Bonfires and war with the dwarves.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> But after centuries of war, the Second Children changed: they became obsessed with
                the total destruction of the dwarves and so they chained themselves to the Bonfires, harnessing the
                Divine against its wills. They became the orcs.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Appalled at what their Children had become, the Divines sent their First Children to
                bring the orcs back into the fold, but the orcs rebelled, sacrificing some of the First Children on the
                Bonfires and thus was born the human race.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Centuries have passed and the Middle Realm changes those that walk there.
                The First Children eventually called it home and became the elves.</p>
            <h1>WHICH RACE SHOULD I CHOOSE?</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your race effects character creation in 3 ways: Stat Score Modifiers,
                Gameplay Rewards, and Archetype Costs. If you're new to RPGs in generally, go for a race that interests
                you based on the flavor.</p>
            <h3>STAT SCORE MODIFIERS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These modify the base stats that you roll. You can use it to balance out
                your character's weak spots or you can use it to maximize what your character is already good it. We
                recommend the latter as Bonfire is a game built around teamwork: you'll have friends who will be good at
                things your character isn't.</p>
            <h3>GAMEPLAY REWARDS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each race is meant to encourage a certain type of play. For instance, orcs
                gain bonuses for starting things, like combats or social conflicts, so they reward players who are
                aggressive, while elves get rewarded for being careful with how they engage with others. These are noted
                under the Racial Temperament section in their summary. </p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Some races can spend less time mastering things than others, freeing up time (CrP)
                to focus on other pursuits or becoming true masters of their vocation. This is reflected in the
                Archetype Costs.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You'll notice that some races will have Archetype Exceptions: these are
                based on the lore of that race for the Middle Realm, the official campaign setting of Bonfire. GMs
                should feel free to modify these prices. Actually, GMs should modify any prices to fit their setting.
            </p>
            <h1>RACIAL PREFERENCES</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Racial tensions exist in the Middle Realm and there’s bad blood between the
                different species, plus, some races get on other's nerves because of differing temperaments. When in a
                Conflict against some races, you can sometimes gain Leverage to resist (or they get Leverage to convince
                you). </p>

                as a whole: they're efete and cowardly and can be extremely passive-aggressive to an orc, so immediately
                they start off on the wrong foot, giving the orc a d6! to resist the elf's coercion. The elf, realizing
                that this is going to be harder than it needs to be because of the orcs bullheadedness and general lack
                of forethought, goes to the his human friend and tries to get him to sign on. Because humans like elves,
                the elf would get a d6! to convince him instead. </p>

            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Changelings are strange little beings. The rumors are that their demons
                who've trade places with human children left out in the wild or that they're the stillborn children of
                wizards and witches. Either way, their wiliness and techincal prowess make them welcome guests where
                every they end up. </p>
            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Changelings were said to first appear in the employ of hedge wizards and witches in
                the hinterlands of the Rhon mountains. They were usually attached to a village, where they worked as
                tinkers and menders, or as helpers in workshops. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> During the spread of the First Empire, many officials specifically went out and
                drafted them, recruiting them as armours, sappers, or magic-users in the army or household artists, as
                they had a keen artistic eye and creative spirit. They formed their own communities and many bought
                their freedom, seeking their own way in the world but many stayed as it was a good gig. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> As the First Empire fell, many changelings simply integrated into the local culture.
                Those that didn't often found themselves the target of persecution, accused of being traitors to the
                Empire or simply scapegoated for their unwillingness to give up their culture. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> With the rise of the Second Empire, they have, however, once again found a
                safe place in the machinary of state, but many still long for the quiet life in a tucked away community
                where they can tinker and mend away. </p>
            <h3>APPEARANCE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Changelings are about the size of a 10 year old human, with extremely pale skin,
                unsually long fingers and large eyes. Besides this, they appear like little humans, with whispy hair on
                their head and face. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They dress in whatever the area custom is but tend towards bright and
                clashing colors. </p>
            <h3>PERSONALITY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Changelings are wily and crafty, and, while not lacking in morality, tend to get
                caught up on whatever project they're currently on. They enjoy puzzles more than anything - the thrill
                of having everything click into place just perfectly is the finest thing a person can experiance. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also tend to be on the shy side, as much as possible, keeping out of
                the limelight. Worldly power and accolades hold little appeal for them, but there is a sense of wanting
                to be apart something greater than keeps them reaching out to the outside world. </p>

            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Dwarves are called the 'Stonemen' not because they're made of stone but
                because they're hard as rock. They're obstinate and incorrigible and, as a rule, they never do anything
                that someone else wants them to do. As such, they're the most disagreeable beings in the Middle Realm.
                They're also the most straightforward, brave, and loyal beings as well. </p>
            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Dwarves were made by the Divine Rostam for one purpose: to try and get the other
                Divines to stop huffing their own farts and realize their not infalible. As such, he took their favorite
                children, those beings that would become the elves, and flipped them on their head. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Needless to say, when these little buggers became running around the Higher World,
                the other Divines were not amused and quickly tried to get rid of them by banishing them to the Void.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Well, the dwarves were not going to be beaten so easily. After all, any one could be
                sentenced to non-existance by being throwing into the endless Nothing. So, they slew the guardian, Ymir,
                and threw his body into the Nothing and thus created the Middle Realm. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The rest of dwarven history is filled with the Divine's futile attempts to scrub
                them from the world but finally as the gods began to relax and realize how much they overracted, the
                Dwarves soon found themselves fighting amongst themselves. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Currently, they've ditched their isolation policy and have begun to
                interact with the outside world. </p>
            <h3>APPEARANCE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Dwarves are the opposite of elves. They're short, barrel chested with thick hair
                growing all over their bodies. This hair ranges from coal black to a golden hue, depending on which hold
                the dwarf hails from. They also always support big bushy beards that are near hard as steel. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> These beards are their pride and joy and they take great care in them. Woven into
                each beard is the tale of that dwarf's life and accomplishments as well as their job within the hold.
                You can learn a lot from reading a dwarf's beard. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Besides this and their tools, the dwarves really don't take care of themselves,
                eschewing anything showy or fancy, like nice fabrics or baths. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Dwarf anatomy is, thankfully, a mystery to most outsiders. All dwarves, to
                other races, appear human and use human pronouns, though in dwarvish, their are no pronouns because
                that's more bothersome. There is a rumor that their are female dwarves but that there's 0 sexual
                dimorphism in the species, which makes courting a very careful affair, but the running theory is that
                female dwarves are just anvils. </p>
            <h3>PERSONALITY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> As stated before, dwarves are subborn. They're very rarely, however,
                psychopathically so. More often, once they have decided something, they tend to get defencive and refuse
                to relent unless they absolutely have to. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> This makes dwarven governments and social structures very slow moving and difficult
                to work with but, it also means that if you get a dwarf to agree with you, they will happily die on that
                hill. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> In fact, the only time that a dwarf seems to be happy is when he's being stubborn
                about something. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Finally, dwarves do not ascribe to social niceties. It's not that they're
                incapabile to understanding them or aware of them: they just don't think they're worth paying attention
                to, in the same way that most people don't notice insects. </p>

            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Elves are the first born of the Divines. Originally, the inhabitants of
                the Painted World, the source of all magic, they now inhabit the Middle Realm as mentally ethereal
                beings.</p>
            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> After the corruption of the Orcs, the Divines sought another means of assailing the
                Dwarves in their holds. They turned to the First Children, the Elves.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> So, they marshaled the elven forces and invaded the Middle Realm.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The invasion proved more fruitful than the first one. The Elves’ ethereal nature
                allowed them to interact with the Middle Realm without being corrupted by it and their corporeal bodies
                allowed them to wage war on the Dwarves on their own terms.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> But there were side effects of their new environment. The Elves, who used to be
                nearest to the Divines, found that they were now less connected to their creators. With all that reality
                in the way, their prayers had a harder time of reaching the Divines.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After generations, the Elves have become dispersed, their common cause
                mostly forgotten and their heritage lost to the mists of time. Some continue the war, but most of them
                have integrated into the societies of the Middle Realm as artisans, scholars, and wizards.</p>
            <h3>APPEARANCE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Elves are slender beings that are widely considered classically beautiful, though
                many find their features alien and off putting. They uniformly have long ears that taper to a point at
                the end.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Their eyes are pure white, with no iris or pupil visible, this matched with their
                sharp teeth, can give them a feline turn to their face.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Elves naturally survive off the ebb and flow of magic that drifts through
                the air of the Painted World. While still present in the Middle Realm, these winds are a sliver of their
                natural magnitude and so Elves need to find other sources; the main one being through the magic inherent
                in all living creatures. While vegetables do have magic in them, an Elf would have to consume 100s of
                pounds of lettuce each day to not die of starvation. The only realistic way of getting enough magic to
                survive is through the consumption of raw meat. </p>
            <h3>PERSONALITY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> To describe an Elf as “careful” would be a huge understatement. They tend to live
                longer than other races, not because some supernaturally long lifespan, but because they're always
                careful about their actions. They see other races as brash and impetuous while they're in turn seen as
                slow and cowardly. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> It's not they're incapable of great emotion or quick action but elves seem to
                understand that with every action comes a consquence, whether that action was well meaning or not, and
                that this karmic force is more powerful than any other law or power. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> However, once set on a course, it is hard to dissaude an elf, for they do
                nothing lightly.</p>

            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Gaunts are said to be depraved creatures stuck between life and death. They
                love filthy lucre more than what made them human. They're those that, for whatever reason, have sold
                part of their souls for either money or at a change at eternal life in the world to come. </p>
            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> During the last days of the Old Vyatichi Kingdom, those with the power sought a way
                to cheat death and become immortal. While they didn't find the cure, they found a bandage: soul shiving,
                the process of grafting a piece of another's soul onto one's own to prolong your life. The priests and
                shamans talked about the gift they would give those who did this: how a piece of their soul would travel
                with them to heaven after death, granting even the vilest sinner reprieve. They also offered a hefty pay
                bonus too. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> And thus the first gaunts were born as the husks of those that sought a shortcut to
                salvation. Once the Empire took over, they outlawed the practices but it couldn't be undone, not the
                ritual or the knowledge and certain government officials also partook until it was an open secret. Many
                became man servants or thralls to these officials, pulled by some invisible thread together. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Crack downs by the Orthodoxy, both on practioners and gaunts themselves took place,
                with many going into hiding while others were rounded up into ghettoes. Many were burned at the stake
                during the last years of the Empire. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Not that the gaunts seemed to care. With salvation in the next world secured, most
                lived riot, indulging in the most depraved and headless way possible. Forming gangs and joining
                outcasts, becoming actors, and living life as if every day was their last. This, along with the church's
                indictment, only further estranged them from society. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And so on the edges of those societies they live, for the most part.
                Joining acting troopes or sellsword companies and generally making their way in the world where they can
                find a place to live out their final mortal days. </p>
            <h3>APPEARANCE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Gaunts of all races look generally the same as the soul shiving process drains them
                of their vitality. Their skin turns ghost white, their hair a weak grey, and their eyes become milky as
                if they're blind. Their bodies becoming desiccated, thin and reedy. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> They still need to eat, drink, and do other bodily functions - they are, even after
                all that, living. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Gaunts tend to dress in flamboyent clothing that is a mix and match of
                whatever they kind find. Most say this is because they loot the clothing off of those they kill but it's
                more likely because they just wear what they can find or because they wish to make up for their dull
                color palette </p>
            <h3>PERSONALITY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> As stated, gaunts get a bad rep for being wholely without morals but that's not
                always the case. Some have undergone the process because they need to feed thier families or out of a
                powerful sense of devotion or religious zeal so actually gaunts run the spectrum of personality types:
                they're just saddled with their reputation because of an admittedly not small section of them. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> What makes up the gaunt's personality is why he made the sacrifice to do
                what he did. Why was so precious to him that he would make such a huge sacrifice for? That's a
                complicated question and not easy to answer by the gaunt player should have their answer before play
                begins. </p>

            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Humans are the first natives of the Middle Realm. They are creatures born
                from strife, who’ve carved for themselves a place in the world through fire, steel, and grit.</p>
            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The first Humans were born from the embers and ash of the Bonfires during the
                Elf-Orc Wars. Orc warlords discovered they could strengthen and corrupt the Bonfires by burning Elves
                alive in the its flame.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> But out of the remains rose new life: a creature of both heaven and earth.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> These children of the Middle Realm survived by forming clans in the hills and
                mountains, away from the fighting, and there they began to thrive.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The turning point in their civilization was when the Divines discovered their unique
                connection with the Humans. Each Human carried a Bonfire inside them, making them perfect vessels for
                the favor of the gods. The Divines began focusing their attention on them and bestowing their gifts on
                their adopted children.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Humans have now become the preeminent race in the Middle Realm, with
                kingdoms and empires across the world.</p>
            <h3>APPEARANCE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The Humans of the Middle Realm look like you and me. Their skin, eye, and hair color
                range widely, adapted to the region of that Human’s origin, with darker skins more common towards the
                equator.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you don’t know what a Human looks like, I don’t know what to tell you.
            </p>
            <h3>PERSONALITY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The truth is Humans are odd and quirky individuals that seem to have the defining
                trait of their curiosity and ambition.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Truthfully, you probably have your own opinion about how humans behave and
                why they behave the way they do and nothing I write in this little blurb is going to convince you
                otherwise.</p>

            <p style="margin:0px;"> The rise of the minotaurs trace their origin back to the Sack of Um Badr, an event
                that, at the time only mattered to the Beja, but would have world changing consquences. Details are
                sketchy since beastmen are barbaric and don't keep records but the story goes that using the Bonfire in
                the city, the minotaurs were able to forge a New Covenant with the Divines, granting them almost human
                intelligence. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> From there, the minotaurs organized themselves together and swept through the Rhon,
                subjegating the tribes there, overrunning the dwarven hold and learning all that they could. And like
                that, the First Empire was born. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Like an unstoppable tide, it conquered most of the known world - bringing all under
                one banner. And so there was an age of peace undreamed off. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> But it wouldn't last: minotaurs, while inspired warriors and generals, have no real
                strong talent for statecraft. Religious revivials, both at home and abroad caused cultural and
                population shifts that destablized the government. Rich merchants were soon flexing their power over
                officials, with wanton corruption investing all levels. It was all too much and the Empire cracked and
                fell apart. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Now there are minotaur kingdoms dotted the land, powerful but small states, but most
                make there way in other's lands. Still, there legacy lives on with their symbols still used by
                burgeoning states, event those founded by their traditional enemies. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> But, alas, the new Empire that now conqueres only pays lip service to them
                and is founded by humans who seek to be associated with bygone ages. </p>
            <h3>APPEARANCE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Minotaurs are huge creatures that are half man and half bull. Specifically, the head
                and upper torse, as well as the legs are bull, while the chest, shoulders, and arms are those of a man.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Both male and female are larger than the average person, with males standing on
                average about 7 ft tall and the woman standing at around 6 ft tall. Males sprout horns, though they lack
                the strength to effectively gore with them like their bull counterparts. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Their skin color, as well as their fur color and pattern, vary by region,
                with traditionall tanner skinned minotaurs coming from the south and light skinned ones coming from the
                north but during the days of the First Empire there was so much population movement that this is a trend
                rather than a rule. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Note that Minotaurs are more closely related to Beastfolk than they are to
                cows and so are, in fact, carnivorous. </p>
            <h3>PERSONALITY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Minotaurs cut royal figures and their personalities match. They have an extreme
                sense of pride and a great depth of feeling in accordance with their beastial nature. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They're extremely devoted to whatever cause they throw their weight behind
                and there is no difference to them between their opinions and themselves, making them very cocksure.
                This can, unsurprisingly, make them bullies as they care little for other's opinions about things. </p>

            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Avenging angels who know how to make war like others know how to breathe.
                The Orcs have been corrupted by the Middle Realm, now forging their destiny with their own hands.</p>
            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Confounded by the Dwarves, who used the corpse of Ymir to form the Middle Realm and
                shield themselves from the power of the Divines, the Divines began to formulate an invasion to massacre
                the Stone Folk.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> They crafted corporeal angels to wage war in the Middle Realm and they created the
                Bonfires as heavenly invasion points.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Centuries passed and the Orcs changed. Ages of violence transformed them and they
                became narrow minded in their pursuit of the total destruction of the dwarvish race.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> It was discovered that Orcish warlords could link themselves to the Bonfires,
                wresting power from the Divines against their will, and so the gods turned their backs on their wayward
                children.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> But the wars continued and the Orcs used the link to elevate their own ancestors to
                a faux deity state, replacing the Divines.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Orcs, since blinded by war, have been crushed and dispersed, their
                descendants found as mercenaries and bandits across the Middle Realm, with a few Orcish Warlords still
                offering resistance from their ancient citadels.</p>
            <h3>APPEARANCE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Orcs have dark green or grey skin with porcine nose and tusks that jut up from their
                lower jaw. They tend to be stocky, with thick muscles and hunched shoulders.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Their hair is wiry, closer to steel wool than anything else and their eyes are
                completely black, with no pupils or irises, giving them an indescribable inhumanness to it.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Naturally, Orcs are scavengers, able to survive on practically anything, no
                matter how rotten or foul.</p>
            <h3>PERSONALITY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> An Orc’s whole life revolves around conflict and they tend to view the world in that
                way. If it doesn’t allow them to get a leg up on their enemy, why bother with it?</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The issue is that they don’t really have common sense: if it doesn’t directly relate
                to warfare, they don’t see the benefit.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> So, weapons and armor, sure, but growing food? I don’t see how it gives me the leg
                up. Let others do it and I’ll just raid them for theirs.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Orcs aren’t that much dumber than the average person but their brains tend
                to overheat when thinking about complex topics.</p>

            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Ratfolk are social creatures. They love people and being around people.
                Others find them pleasant to be around. As such, Ratfolk can be found as diplomats, traders, and
                minstrals. </p>
            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Ratfolk were the result of advanced Bejaian magics. After the Gothic and Capatian
                rebels, a spirit of fear riot in the city-states that a similar uprising might quickly come so the need
                for loyal servants inspired some of the greatest magic-users of the age to begin work on creating a race
                of people specifically made to be amenable. Thus, the first ratfolk. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Under the Empire, ratfolk came into high demand and those the Beja were secretive
                with their secrets, they were happy to swap them for coin and thus the creatures spread all over the
                continent, mainly as house servants. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> They eventually became extremely well known for making excellent spies and were
                called in to defuse hostile situations, as if they radianted an innate calming aura. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> But magic is wily and it soon became clear that the ratfolk were cunning, desiring
                more out of life than just to play second fiddle to others and so they sold their skills to the dwarven
                holds and enemies of the Empire to gain their freedom and a level of automony. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And so the last Primarch of the Empire fell by ratfolk hands, putting the
                last nail in the coffin. </p>
            <h3>APPEARANCE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Ratfolk are smaller and slimmer than other races, with lithe, fur covered
                bodies that range from auburn to dark black. They have beady eyes and long tails. For the most part,
                they appear like their smaller cousins, though with lighter frames and opposible thumbs. </p>
            <h3>PERSONALITY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> As stated, ratfolk are people people. They're extremely social and, as a rule, are
                extroverted. They tend to be agreeable and try to get along with everyone but this shouldn't be taken as
                people pleasing or weak because ratfolk are clever - dangerously so. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> People tend to think that because ratfolk are so easy going that they're push overs
                and that they can be taken advantage of but ratfolk sees it as "I'll scratch your back, you scratch
                mine" kind of deal so they're not just going to do things to do things. They very much believe in the
                social contract, but their animal nature makes them ruthless as some points. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> In fact, ratfolk can be quite ruthless to those they deem outside their pack, which
                has earned them some reputation as having a herd mentality. For ratfolk the only war is total war. </p>
            <h5>Archetypes</h5>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Archetypes represent your character’s background training and starting skills. Your
                character’s class is a gestalt of two Archetypes of your choosing.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Archetypes are divided into Archetype Categories: Expert, Caster, Servant,
                Socialite, and Fighter. These represent the overall theme of the individual Archetype. For instance,
                Fighter Archetypes tend to be good at things related to combat. So, if you’re looking to make a combat
                focused character, you can look there.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> You choose a Primary and a Secondary Archetype and pay the price in CrP for both
                based on your race.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You use the Vitality Die, the Skills & Masteries, and the Primary Drawback
                sections from the Primary, and combine both Archetype Abilities section, though you remove 1 leveling
                ability from your Secondary Archetype.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> While you may want to double down into the exact same Archetype, Caster Archetypes
                are the only ones that you can do that with. You may choose two Archetypes from the same Category,
                however.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your GM may choose to reject an Archetype combination based on the fact
                that the two Archetypes don’t fit together thematically. So, while a Thief/Priest (Beast Covenant) might
                be really powerful because of the Beast Covenant’s Shape Changing ability, if there’s not a Patron of
                Thieves and Animals in the campaign world, you’re out of luck.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If two characters have the same ability, unless it says otherwise, those
                abilities stack.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Expert Archetypes are those that focus on real-world non-combat skills, as opposed
                to relying on the Divines or magic as a source of strength.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Expert Archetypes tend to rely on Intellect and Wisdom, primarily.</p>
            <h1>ADVENTURER</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Adventures gain the most free skills of all Archetypes allowing for the
                largest breathe of knowledge, however, they’re cheaper skills. They can also help others, giving them a
                chance to try again at Skill Checks they fail.</p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d8</p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Adventurers receive 2 free purchases of any two different, non-Lore Skill
                Suites. </p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HELPING HAND</strong> The Adventurer is not just about
                knowing things but also giving others a helping hand in times of need. When another person uses an
                Adventurer’s help, either as an Asset, or one of his Helper Skills or Preparation, they receive an
                additional +1 to their roll. This bonus increases by +1 for every 2 levels the Adventurer has obtained.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MIDDLE NAME: DANGER</strong> For the Adventurer, danger
                is calming and straightforward and that’s what they crave. Whenever an Adventurer takes damage, they can
                heal that amount of Stress. This doesn’t heal Stress from wounds, however. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Any < 7 CrP, 6)</strong> At first level and
                        every level up, Adventurers receive 6 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any
                        Advanced Skills under 7 CrP in base cost (before Skill Adept and Stat Score reduction) within
                        either of the two Skill Suites he picked at first level. These free purchases may not be doubled
                        up on in the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL ADEPT</strong> This character has a knack
                for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all
                Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Adventurers tend to eschew book smarts for street smarts: the Lore Skill
                Suite and any Lore Advanced Skills cost double.</p>
            <h1>ASSASSIN</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Assassin is a master killer, gaining a chance to increase their damage
                against unaware opponents and being able silence helpless ones quickly. They're also masters of poison
                use, knowing how to most effectively apply their killer medicine.</p>
            <h3>VITALITY</h3>

            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Assassins receive 1 free purchase of the Streetwise Skill Suite.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BACKSTAB</strong> When using any small melee weapon

                you, personally, mean harm to them), the Assassin’s damage explodes on the highest and second highest
                result. i.e., d4!s explode on natural 3s and 4s. They also gain an additional dice of damage every 2
                levels when backstabbing, which doesn’t increase the total number of dice for /D armor.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> If an opponent flees and the Assassin is within half their weapon Recovery, they may
                Backstab using half their additional damage dice from this ability.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IMPROVED COUP de GRACE</strong> An Assassin has studied
                the weak parts of their target’s anatomy and can quickly make a killer strike. Coup de Graces only take
                5 seconds. This is always done completely silent. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COOL HEADED </strong>Where others would get blustered,
                the Assassin stays cool, even when he’s stressing. When making a Skill Check, lower the base amount of
                Stress you get by 2.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILLED POISONER</strong> An Assassin has
                intimate knowledge of poisons and how to use them. When someone is poisoned by the Assassin, increase
                that poison's Lethality by 1 for every level that Assassion has obtained. </p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Being a trained killer is not an honorable profession and people don’t like
                murders around. If your profession becomes publicly known, you lose 5 Honor. </p>
            <h1>MASTERMIND</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Mastermind is a plotter: preparing themselves and laying out plans
                before they step foot into the Skill Challenge. They get bonuses for utilizing all the options presented
                in the Strategies section, meaning that, by the time they step into the ring, they’re unbeatable in
                their element.</p>

            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Masterminds receive 1 free purchase of Skill Suite of their choice.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FRIENDS in ALL PLACE </strong>A Mastermind has contacts
                and knows how to use them. When using an Asset, the Mastermind gains a +1 at first level and increases
                it by 1 for every level they’ve obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>METHODICALLY MINDED </strong>If you’re careful with how
                you treat your equipment and come prepared, you can see yourself through a tough spot. You may pay 15
                Stress so that you or others who use your equipment ignore the degradation of a piece of equipment you
                use on a Check. This Stress penalty is lowered by 1 every 3 levels down to a minimum of 3.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PREP PAYS OFF </strong>People take pride in having their
                plans work out, the Mastermind doubly so. Whenever a reroll from Preparation results in a success when
                the original roll would have caused a failure, the Mastermind receives 1 free use of their Honor Die for
                the rest of the Skill Challenge.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>The RIGHT TOOL for the RIGHT TIME </strong>If you’re
                careful with how you treat your equipment and come prepared, you can see yourself through a tough spot.
                Once per Skill Challenge and an additional time for every 2 levels they’ve obtained, ignore the
                degradation of a piece of equipment you use on a Check.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Any, 3)</strong> At first level and every
                level other up, Masterminds receive 3 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any
                Advanced Skill. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after
                Skills have been bought by the Character.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL ADEPT </strong>This character has a knack
                for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all
                Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Failure means that the Mastermind didn’t plan as well as he should have. He
                gains an additional 2 Stress Dice at the end of any Skill Challenge for each Obstacle that he fails,
                even if he got what he wanted out of the Challenge. </p>
            <h1>OPPORTUNIST</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There’s just something about these types of people that seem to warp
                probability in their favor. And those lucky few who use this to their advantage to go far.</p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">the higher of 2d6 </p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Opportunists gain the Skills & Masteries from their Secondary Archetype.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LUCKY </strong> The Opportunist is naturally
                blessed with the ability to get out of trouble and use that adrenaline that comes as death comes near to
                dodge the grim reaper and keep running. After the results are given, the Opportunist can take 2 Stress
                to modify his results by 1. These may be done with the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They can never be used to make you a better fighter. Stress gained this way can only be used to
                    dodge death or escape a bad situation but never to make your character a superman. </li>
                <li>The character must think of a situation that saves his rear end, something that happens to him
                    that’s to his advantage. </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin:0px;">The key here is that it can’t be impossible but it can be highly improbable. The
                chandelier rope breaking right at that moment separating him from a blood thirsty guard, a pigeon flying
                across an archer’s view intercepting an arrow, etc. are all acceptable.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">It can’t be the result of skill. Him deflecting the blade with his hand like a badass
                is right out.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Should the character be unable to think of a scenario that fits both of these
                criteria, he’s unable to gain Stress to save himself.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FALL FORWARD </strong>Some people seem to stubble into
                where they need to be, even when they completely fail. When the Opportunist fails a Check, takes damage,
                or loses a round, he gains a roll of his Honor Dice. This is limited to 1 initially (so failing a second
                roll won't do him any good at level 1), but for every 3 levels the Opportunist has obtained, he
                increases the max number of Honor Dice this ability gives him by 1.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NATURAL ADVANTAGE </strong>A Opportunist lives on his
                wits and his ability to use every advantage. At the start of every Combat, Conflict, or Skill Challenge,
                he may change one thing about the field for every 10 Stress he takes. These changes must be consistent
                with an overarching setting (he can’t choose to have the inn change to a ship or flood right at that
                moment but he can choose to have a convenient chair or barrel right behind one of his enemies or
                reposition himself next to the fighter).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Stress is lowered by 1 for every level he’s obtained, down to 3, though
                he may use this ability multiple times, but it doubles the Stress penalty each time he does so. This
                resets the next time he has the opportunity to heal Stress.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Luck is a top heavy thing: Opportunists don’t get their Vitality reroll
                every other level, however, they do get bumped up to their Min. Vitality from their Constitution if
                they’re below it. </p>
            <h1>PROFESSIONAL</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While other Experts focus on knowledge, the Professional focuses on when to
                apply that knowledge and how to use their time effectively. The work with the Clocks of the Skill
                Challenge primarily, rather than being just good at Skill Checks. </p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d6 </p>

            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>UNDER PRESSURE </strong>When times get tough, the tough
                get going and the Professional is tough. The first time an Obstacle becomes Active, you gain an
                additional use of your Honor Die for the remainder of the Conflict. This increases by 1 Honor Die for
                every level you’ve obtained and only happens once for each Obstacle.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BUYING TIME </strong>The sands of the hourglass trickle
                onward but sometimes you can slow it down for a moment or two. During a Skill Challenge on a failed
                Check, you can sacrifice Honor to increase your roll by 2. This can’t, however, turn the failure into a
                success.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WATCHING EACH OTHER’S BACK </strong>Whenever one does
                their job, everyone can rest easy. If two or more allies are Multitasker, they both get a +1 to one of
                their rolls for every 2 levels the Professional has obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Any, 3)</strong> At first level and every
                level other up, Professional receive 3 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any
                Advanced Skill. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after
                Skills have been bought by the Character.</p>

                for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all
                Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Professional is a man of reputation and so, when it is besmirched, it
                affects him gravely. For every 5 Honor you lose, lose an additional 1.</p>
            <h1>RANGER</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Ranger’s strengths rely mostly in their survival skills, making them
                excellent to have in the wilderness but they also gain a bonus to their movement that allows them to out
                pace others during skirmishes. </p>

            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Rangers receive 1 free purchase of the Survival Skill Suite.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPES ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>QUICK FOOTED</strong> The Ranger relies on being able to
                cross great swaths of land quickly, chasing down their prey. At first level and for every 2 levels he’s
                obtained, the Ranger increases his base movement rate categories by 1 foot. He can't increase it again
                until all other movement categories have been increased in a like manner.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> A first level Ranger can choose Stroll/Crawling, Walking, Jogging, Running,
                Sprinting. If he chooses Walking, his Walk becomes 6 ft / second. At level 3, he can chose
                Strolling/Crawling, Jogging, Running, or Sprinting, but not Walking. After he's increased all by 1 ft,
                he can go back and increase his Walk again.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PUT YOUR HEADS TOGETHER</strong> For survival,
                communication is key and doing so quickly is often extremely important. When using each other as Assets,
                all allies of the Ranger have their Investment Time start at 1 hour instead of 2 hours and 45 minutes.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Survival, 5)</strong> At first level and

            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Ranger finds armor restricting and irritating: all Armor Advanced
                Trainings are 2 CrP more expensive per Tier (Tier 1: 10 CrP, Tier 3: 22 CrP).</p>
            <h1>SAGE</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Sage gets some of the most expensive and cerebral skills for free but
                also, because of his intense training, he has the ability to instantly reroll any skill he chooses.</p>

            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MEMORY TRAINING</strong>The Sage’s training doesn’t just
                revolve around studying but also on how to study, allowing them better recall of information than those
                without such mental discipline. The Sage may reroll 1 Int, Wis, or Cha based Skill Check for 15 Stress.
                They may do this multiple times but each time they do so between opportunities where they can heal
                Stress costs them double, however, they also lower this Stress gain by 1 for every 2 levels they’ve
                obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FRANK DISCUSSION </strong>You can often get more out of
                a discussion than you can simply thinking about something. When used as an Asset, the person receives a
                +1 to their Skill Check and an additional +1 for every 3 levels the Sage has obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Lore, 5)</strong> At first level and every
                level up, Sages receive 5 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced Skill from
                the Lore Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied
                after Skills have been bought by the Character. </p>

            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Sage has spent most of his time buried in study and so may take a bit
                longer to react to reality: they always roll an initiative die 2 sizes larger. </p>
            <h1>THIEF</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Thief has the widest variety of skills, picking from a uniquely built

            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ANIMAL AFFINITY </strong>The Wilderman has a natural
                connection to the beasts. As such, he can form bonds with them quicker than humans. A Wilderman can use
                one of his followers at anytime to attract an environmentally appropriate animal companion instead.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">You may never gain more than 1 animal companion at one time.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONING </strong>Being outside in all
                seasons and weather, hardens the Wilderman. He considers himself up to 40 degrees warmer or colder than
                the surrounding climate.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ONE PACK </strong>The Wilderman knows that you either
                survive together or die separately. Anyone can use anyone else’s Honor Dice, however they take Stress
                equal to what they roll on it.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ANIMAL FRIEND </strong>Being around animals allows you
                to really get in their head and communicate with them on a level that civilized people just can't. This
                ability allows the Wilderman to get into a Conflict with any Natural Animals to move their disposition
                from Hostile to Neutral or from Neutral to Friendly, though not from Hostile to Neutral in one Conflict.
                This is only temporary, however, ending a few hours after first contact.</p>

            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A Wilderman finds no comfort in society and they often find themselves
                ill-at-ease in the company of others: all races are considered 2 steps down the Racial Preference table.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Though much study and natural talent, Caster Archetypes can channel the Painted
                World, using its power to alter reality.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Caster Archetypes rely more on clever applications of spells rather than
                outright doing damage and so can often subtly shift the playing field in their favor. They rely mainly
                on Intellect and Wisdom since they need a high Stress Threshold as it is extremely stressful to shape
                Weird.</p>

            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">An Augur is one who watches the stars. The times and seasons are linked to
                the swirl of constellations overhead and the ways of magic. Those that watch them carefully can harness
                their power. An Augur gains bonuses based on the passage of time, making them change with the times.</p>

            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ASTRUM IUNGO </strong>As part of their training, Augurs
                are taught how to harness the magic that drifts down from the stars and constellations. This gives them
                a steady pool of Spell Points whenever they cast a spell.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">At first level, all spells the Augur casts have 7 SPs. This can be spent to modify
                the spell that they’re casting. It does take a moment to summon the astral forces, so casting a spell
                takes 3 seconds.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">They increase this by 1 SP for every other level they obtain.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LECTIO COTIDIE </strong>At the beginning of each day,
                the Augur reads the signs and divines which of the astral winds, and thus which Weird Tradition, is most
                dominant on that day. This happens in a cycle based on the days of the week.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">When casting a spell from the Tradition linked to the day, the Augur receives an
                extra d4! SP to spend on that spell. This extra dice is increased by 1 size for every 3 levels they
                obtain.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">If you lose track of the day of the week, you’ve lost track of the stars and don’t

                that applies to the particular Rudiment. This is increased by 1 SP for every 5 levels they’ve obtained.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">So, for instance, if this week is associated with Shape, roll on the Shape Rudiments
                Table found in Chapter 12: The Weird. If you roll, say Chain, all Chain spells you cast gain an
                additional SP.</p>

                a pool of 3 Honor Dice that they can use for spell casting anytime during the month. This pool is
                increased by 1 Honor Dice for every level they’ve obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">This pool refreshes on the first day of every month.</p>

            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Augurs are extremely superstitious since everything is controlled by fate and the
                stars. Bad luck means a bad fate. They take 1 Stress every time they roll a 1 on a d20. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to
                take another Caster Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double down in their
                Primary.</p>

            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The mage is one that allows himself to be buffeted by the astral winds and
                so channels great power but also is in great danger. The mage has the most raw power of the Caster
                Archetypes but it could backfire on him.</p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Mage receives the Skills & Masteries of his Secondary Archetype.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WILD MAGIC CASTING</strong> The Mage is able to channel
                the power of the stars, harnessing it and creating magical energy. While doing so the caster must stand
                still and he glows with light, being illuminated by a column that reaches above them. This light is
                equivalent to a candle’s brightness.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">After 7 seconds, the Mage gains their Spell Points. Unlike other Archetypes
                of this type, however, a lot is left up to chance. The Mage rolls randomly for the Shape, Origin, and
                Range of the spell and d4! SP that they can spend on the Effect.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">They also gain an additional d4! “free” SP that can either be spent on the Effect, or
                to modify what they rolled on the tables on a 1 to 1 basis.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When considering Drain, the Mage only has to worry about the Effect’s Base
                Drain and so, essentially, gets the other Rudiments for free. As long as he has more Spell Points than
                Drain, he can keep the spell cast.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">So, for example, a level 3 Mage finishes channelling and casts Flashbang. He rolls
                randomly and gets Circle, Double, and Aura, He rolls d8 and gets a 5 the Effect. He rolls his free dice
                and gets a 3. Since he’s casting Flashbang, he doesn’t want it to be an Aura (since he’ll be caught in
                it to), so he spends 2 of his free points to move it to “Near”, and then uses the final point to give
                him 6 SP so he can actually cast it.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Flashbang has an Interval of 5 Seconds, so he subtracts 3 from 6 when he
                casts the spell and then, after 5 seconds, does so again to essentially recast it. As long as you have
                SPs you can keep a spell active.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can also suffer weirdburn from keeping a spell up too long: if your
                spell’s Drain is greater than your current SP, the spell is still cast, but you and everyone within 200
                ft takes 1 Stress for every point you’re over.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Going back to the above example: if you have 9 SP, and you keep the spell up
                for 15 seconds, you and those within 200 ft take 4 Stress ( 20 - 3 - 3 ). Should you continue to keep
                the spell up, you’d take an additional 3 Stress every 5 seconds.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">It is recommended that even though you don’t technically get those points
                until after that 7 second duration, that you roll everything ahead of time and figure out what you’re
                going to cast ahead of time. The GM is not obliged to stop the count for you if you haven’t been
                spending those 7 seconds wisely.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can stop shaping at any time, however, you take Stress equal to the
                amount of SP you have left - Weird is a powerful primal force and once unleashed, it is not stopped
                without cost. You also cannot cast or keep up a spell and Channel. This doesn’t remove those SP but the
                Wizard does lose 1 SP every 6 seconds.</p>

                channelling is greater than 4 + level, a Wild Surge occurs. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> In addition to whatever happens with the spell, it is also recast. The new version,
                however, is Circularly Shaped at Full Range and with an Origin of either Aura or Far, as the caster sees
                fit. They also take Stress equal to how much they were over.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EMPOWERED CHANNELING</strong> A Mage relies on an innate
                understanding of the flow of magic through his body and overtime he can increase its effectiveness.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Not starting at first level but happening after every level he's obtained, the Mage
                can either increase the size of any 1 of his dice by 1, or decrease her channelling time by 1, down to a

            <p style="margin:0px;">She may also, indepentelly, decrease her channel time by 1 but this costs an amount
                of CrP equal to X, down to a minimum of 3 seconds.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ASTRAL FULCRUM</strong> There is nothing between the
                Mage and the raw Weird and that allows her to force what others can't. The Mage can 10 Stress in which
                case they gain all their SP in the first second. This is in addition to the normal Fallout.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">However, they still need to complete the channelling: if they don't, they recieve an
                additional 10 Stress. As they become more powerful, however, they learn how to midigate that danger,
                lowering the Stress inflicted by 1 for every 4 levels they've obtained. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SPELL LIST</strong> A Mage gains 6 random Rudiments at
                1st level and an additional Rudiment every 4th level.</p>

                no formal study, they do gain some sort of understanding on the workings of magic, should they choose to

            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The Mage rejects martial prowess as a role and so all weapon masteries cost 3 CrP
                more per Tier (Tier 1: 11 Crp, Tier 3: 24 CrP). </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to
                take another Caster Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double down in their
                Primary.</p>

            <h1>RUNEGALDER</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Unlike other magic-users, the Runegalder seals magical power in his bond,
                allowing him to not risk his body when working with supernatural forces. This allows him to cast quickly
                and consistently but limits the amount and flexibility of his spells.</p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Runegalders receive 1 free purchase of the Lore Skill Suite as well as an
                additional free purchase of Literacy in their native language and the Arcana skill.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>VANCIAN CASTING</strong> The Runegalder chains the power
                of spells to various runes that he then invests, sealing them with his blood until he’s ready to release
                them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Every 24 hours, the Runegalder can seal 3 spells. He can also bind an
                additional spell for every 3 levels he’s obtained. This means that he may cast those spells at any time
                by simply speaking the rune they’re linked to, once prepared. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Speaking the rune releases it from it’s binding so speaking the same rune again
                before he’s resealed it will not recast the spell - the spell’s power is gone. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> He may cast a spell multiple times per day but he’ll need to bind each
                instance of the spell to a different rune. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Speaking a rune in this way doesn’t affect the Runegalder and so he ignores Fallout
                to himself.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> He may also unseal a rune without actually casting it but he is not able to
                immediately reseal a new rune right after.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GRIMOIRE</strong> This is the Runegalder’s spell book
                and keeps the spells that he binds to runes. Unlike a normal spell book, however, the spells are scribed
                in meteorite ink and blood that seals their magic power in the text itself. Essentially, the
                Runegalder’s Grimoire does the channeling latently for him.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Grimoire starts with 8 random Rudiments, though he must have at least
                1 of each, and gains an additional Rudiment every level.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">At level up, he then constructs his spells out of these Rudiments. These spells can’t
                have a Drain greater than 7 + their level (so at 1st level, his spells can only have a Drain of 6) when
                it is scribed into the Grimoire. A spell’s Rudiments cannot be redistributed and changed: spells in the
                Grimoire are immutable.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that spells cast by the Runegalder only last their Interval unless
                their Effect is stacked, in which case, it either increases that Interval by a like amount or gains the
                Stacking bonus. This is decided when the spell is cast.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> So, a 2nd level Runegalder scribes a new spell. He can max out at 7 Drain. He
                chooses to make it a Wall Shape (3 Drain), at Full Range (1 Drain), Near Origin (1 Drain) and for its
                Effect, he choses Disorient (2 Drain), for a total of 7. He could have also made it Chain Shape instead
                for 1 Drain, and Stacked the Disorient Effect, if he wanted. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Spells inscribed at different levels count as completely different spells and must
                be sealed to different runes. So if the Runegalder has a 6 SP Flash Grenade and a 11 SP Flash Grenade,
                he would need two runes to cast both. He couldn’t simply bind “Flash Grenade” to one rune and then
                choose which he wanted to use in the moment.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Arcana, 1)</strong> Through the
                course of her career, a Runegalder seeks to further their knowledge of the occult. They receive 1 free
                purchase of the Arcana Advanced Skill at every other level up. </p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The Runegalder uses his body as a prison for latent magical energies which wears on
                a person over time. He ages at twice the normal rate.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, the Runegalder's magic is 'dead' and so is less potent than other
                types of magic, thus allowing some to shrug off their spells.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> When shaping a spell, the Runegalder rolls a d20! + 10 + their level. All those that
                would be affected by the spell roll a d20! + their level. If their total is above the Runegalder's,
                they're unaffected by his magic. This roll is made regardless of whether or not the person wants to be
                affected by the spell.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to
                take another Caster Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double down in their
                Primary.</p>

            <h1>SOURCERER</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">An ethereal being in a physical world, the Sourcerer draws his magic from an
                internal well within them. As such, they don’t cast spells so much as manifest them into existence.
                Unlike most other casters, the Sourcerer doesn’t rely on luck or Astral Winds, but instead generates
                power from within. This is a slower process making Sourcerers less helpful in the moment but more
                powerful given a bit of time.</p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d8 </p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Sourcerers gain the Skills and Masteries of their Secondary Archetype.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MANIFEST SOURCERY </strong>Whether born under a
                certain constellation or through a long lost bloodline, the Sourcerer has a special connection to the
                Painted World. They’re a font of magic, making them very powerful and very dangerous.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Drawing from within is consistent but takes time. Every 10 seconds, you add the 10s
                digit of the number of SP’s in your pool into your SP pool, minimum 1. So, after 50 seconds of
                manifesting, you would have 15 SPs ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 ).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Sourcerers don’t suffer from normal Fallout and can continue to Manifest for
                as long as they want, however, this power comes with a price. Being a conduit of the unworldly saps
                their life and every time they add SPs to their pool, they take damage equal to that pool.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Manifesting requires light concentration so they can do other things while casting
                spells but if it’s something particularly difficult (like combat or doing mathematics), the Manifesting
                time is doubled. You can also stop Manifesting at any time but your SP pool will atrophy at the rate of
                1 SP per 6 seconds.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>POWER OVERWHELMING </strong>As the Sourcerer grows, they
                also grow in power and can stay between two worlds longer. They reduce the amount of damage taken from
                manifesting by 9 + their level, though they always take at least 1 damage.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRADITION ATTUNED </strong>A Sourcerer is always attuned
                to a certain Weird Tradition and, at 1st level, knows all Effects from that Tradition and 1 random
                Rudiment of each type besides that. Starting at 2nd and 11th level, you can choose a second and third
                Tradition, respectively. At this level and at every other level you obtain, you may select an Effect
                from that secondary Tradition or roll for another random Rudiment.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAGON SKIN </strong>A Sourcerer is a well of
                Weirdcan, therefore, to some exact, absorb Weird that is thrown at them but it comes at a cost. When
                affected by a spell, the Sourcerer can lower the effect by 1 at 1st level and an additional 1 for every
                4 levels they obtain.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Because of Sourcerer is basically a native of another world, their bodies do all they
                can to shlof off the mortal coil. Every Wound takes 1 day longer to heal</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to
                take another Caster Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double down in their
                Primary.</p>

                            15th, you can choose another Tradition. At this level and at every level you obtain, you may

            <h1>SPEAKER</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There is the surface level of things and then there’s how things truly are.
                By striking the threads of magic, a Speaker is able to touch reality and bend it to her will, changing
                it as she pleases. The Speaker has a variable amount of Spell Points available to her, giving her some
                breathing room as well as more flexibility when it comes to casting times.</p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d4 </p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">A Speaker relies on an academic understanding of magic to augment their natural
                powers. They receive 1 free purchase of the Lore Skill Suite for free.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Speakers also have a natural talent for languages and gain the Polyglot
                Mastery for free as well. They quadruple their Lore when determining their starting Language Rank.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ADAMIC COMMAND </strong>To know the First Language is to
                know the words of the Divines, heard as whispers on the mortal plane. Speakers spend decades learning to
                correctly pronounce each syllable and its meaning; learning the subtleties that each inflection brings.
                As they grow in power, the words they speak take on more power.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Once the Speaker decides what their spell will look like (Shape, Origin, Range, and
                Effect) and what its Drain will be, they roll 343 (note that these dice don’t explode). If the result is
                higher than the Drain cost, the spell comes into being. The Speaker is free to roll less dice and/or
                smaller dice, if they so desire.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Speaking words of power takes actually time, specifically 2 seconds per dice
                rolled. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">If 3 - your current Stress Penalty (minimum 1) of the dice you roll come up as 1s,
                the Speaker has made a major mispronunciation and the GM rolls for a random Effect from a random
                Tradition but with otherwise identical dimensions to the spell the Speaker wished to cast.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Since Speakers are not channelling astral power like other magic users, the Stress
                they gain from Fallout is 6 - their level + number of spells cast in the last 24 hours down to a minimum
                of 1.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DICTION TRAINING </strong>As a Speaker gains experience,
                she becomes more able to get around the trickier parts of the Divine syntax and so can add more force
                and power to her spells. Every level, she may either add another d3 to her Adamic dice pool or increase
                the size of one of those dice by 1 (up to a d12).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LEXICON </strong>A Speaker starts with 6 random power
                words or Rudiments to start off and they gain an additional Rudiment every 3rd level. These spells can
                be from any Tradition.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (special) </strong>Through the
                course of her career, a Speaker seeks to further their knowledge of the occult. They receive 1 free
                purchase of the Arcana Advanced Skill and 2 free purchases of the Language Advanced Skill at every level
                up. </p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Obviously, Speakers can’t have the Stutterer or Mute Flaws. Gaining either of those
                two Flaws prevents them from casting.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to
                take another Caster Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double down in their
                Primary.</p>

            <h1>WARLOCK</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Warlock has gone down a dark path and has begun to unlock the innate
                magic in all living creatures. As such, they tend to be social pariahs because the process of extracting
                that magic is random and painful. Still all power has a price and Warlocks happily pay it.</p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d6 </p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A Warlock relies on an academic understanding of magic to augment their
                natural powers. They receive 2 free purchases of the Arcana Advanced Skill for free.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>THE BLOOD PACT </strong>The Warlock has performed a
                secret ritual and has joined the Blood Pact. This has two major benefits:</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The first is that the Aura Origin has a Drain of 0, instead of 5.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">The second is that a Warlock can instantly pull SP from the living creatures around
                him. This gives him 1 SP per second per person within 10 ft but deals that amount of damage to every
                person he is pulling from. This includes himself but he also takes an additional damage per second. This
                blood pull is unaffected by armor but is blocked by other living beings, if they’re closer. Essentially,
                if a person would give you cover from a ranged attack, they also protect you from the blood pull.
                Otherwise these SP act exactly like normal and can be instantly used to cast a spell.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">This amount is increased by 1 SP and damage per second every 6 levels.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This pull is not stealthy at all as the blood is torn from skin and flies to
                the Warlock. Additionally, it is not fully controlled and goes on for a minimum of d4! Seconds. A
                warlock may cast and keep up a spell even when pulling.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">In dire times, the Warlock may also pull from his own blood, with each damage he
                takes giving him double the SPs instead.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SPELL LIST </strong>A Warlock gains 6 random Rudiments
                at 1st level and an additional Rudiment every 3rd level.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Arcana, 1)</strong>Through the
                course of her career, a Warlock seeks to further their knowledge of the occult. They receive 1 free
                purchase of the Arcana Advanced Skill at every other level up.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">People don’t like Blood Magic. By most people’s standards, even at its best, it’s
                dangerous and random and so Warlocks are not well liked. Warlocks are considered 1 level lower on the
                Racial Preference table for everyone that knows they’re a Warlock.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also find other types of Weirdshaping strange and so are unable to
                take another Caster Archetype as their Secondary, however, they are able to double down in their
                Primary.</p>

            <h1>WIZARD</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Wizards, make no mistake, are still Wild Magic casters and are no wimps
                when it comes to raw power, but unlike the Mage that completely gives himself over to the whims of
                magic, the Wizard uses his study and training to lower the hills and increase the troughs, giving more
                consistency.</p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d4</p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Wizard relies on an academic understanding of magic to augment their
                natural powers. They receive the Arcana Advanced Skill for free.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WILD MAGIC CASTING</strong> The Wizard is able to
                channel the power of the stars, harnessing it and creating magical energy. While doing so the caster
                must stand still and he glows with light, being illuminated by a column that reaches above them. This
                light is equivalent to a candle’s brightness.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">After 10 seconds, the Wizard gains d10! Spell Points (SP), which is a single
                pool that can be spent to shape the Weird on the fly out of any Rudiments he knows. The spell’s Drain is
                then subtracted from the Wizard’s Spell Point pool when he casts it and at the Interval. As long as he
                has more Spell Points than Drain, he can keep the spell cast.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Let’s say that you have a spell that is Shaped like a Cone (Drain 3), has a Range of
                Full (Drain 0), an Origin of Aura (Drain 3) and has a Base Drain of 2 from its Effect. That means the
                Drain of that spell is 8 ( 3 + 0 + 3 + 2 ).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If it has an Interval of 30 seconds, when you cast that spell, it costs you
                8 SP and then, after 30 seconds, it costs you another 8 SP, for a total of 16. As long as you have SPs
                you can keep a spell active.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can also suffer weirdburn from keeping a spell up too long: if your
                spell’s Drain is greater than your current SP, the spell is still cast, but you and everyone within 200
                ft takes 1 Stress for every point you’re over.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Going back to the above example of an 8 Drain spell: if you have 20 SP, and
                you keep the spell up for a minute and a half, you and those within 200 ft take 4 Stress ( 20 - 8 - 8 ).
                Should you continue to keep the spell up, you’d take an additional 8 Stress every 30 seconds.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">It is recommended that even though you don’t technically get those points
                until after that 10 second duration, that you roll your SP ahead of time and figure out what you’re
                going to cast ahead of time. The GM is not obliged to stop the count for you if you haven’t been
                spending those 10 seconds wisely.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">This channelling dice increased by 1 for every other level the Wizard has obtained.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">You can stop shaping at any time, however, you take Stress equal to the amount of SP
                you have left - Weird is a powerful primal force and once unleashed, it is not stopped without cost. You
                also cannot cast or keep up a spell and Channel. This doesn’t remove those SP but the Wizard does lose 1
                SP every 6 seconds.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Wild Magic comes with some additional dangers, however. Should the Wizard roll more
                SPs than 8 + his level, he suffers a Wild Surge but untrained in it, he is unable to use it to the best
                of his ability.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">The spell is recast, however, its Circularly Shaped at Full Range and with an Aura
                Origin. They also take Stress equal to how much they were over.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IMPROVED ARCANE TRAINING</strong> The Wizard is trained
                as a good student and so takes less time to learn things when it comes to magic. Arcane Trainings are
                also 4 CrP cheaper for this Archetype and gains a free one every 4 levels.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Additionally, while others can only use their Arcane Training to buff up their
                spells, the Wizard may use the SP gained from it to lower the number of SPs they receive from
                channelling, thus having a chance at avoiding a disastrous Wild Surge or at least minimizing the penalty
                from one.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">More on Arcane Training can be found in <strong>Chapter 7: Masteries</strong>.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WEIRD MEDIUM</strong> The Wizard is a bit more
                impersonal with his relationship with the Weird, preferring to use Weird Mediums as the fulcrum of the
                Weird around him. At first level, he may choose one from the following list.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Should he find himself without his Weird Medium, he’s in trouble. His
                threshold for Wild Surges drops to 5 regardless of level.</p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">

                    <td>
                        <h3>ANCESTOR BONES</h3>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"> This magic user was gifted the bones of his ancestors, powerful wizards
                            from ages past that are able to give their descendants some of their prowess. </p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At 1st level, a Wizard with Ancestor Bones as his Weird Medium
                            lowers his channelling time by 1 second. He also lowers it by an additional second for every
                            5 levels he’s obtained, down to a minimum of 2.</p>
                        <h3>INVESTED ITEM</h3>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">This Medium comes in many shapes and sizes. By binding her soul to an
                            item, a Wizard can make a metal object an extension of her power.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While holding this item, she may cast any spell with Somatic
                            components as if the hand was free. For armor, the Invested Item offsets the penalty to
                            casting by 1 Drain for every 5 levels the Wizard has obtained. This can only offset the
                            penalty, and never lower it below the base speed. For weapons and other items, they may also
                            cast spells with a Touch Origin on a successful hit, storing one spell indefinitely until
                            it’s used. Needless to say, this a much favored Medium of battle mages.</p>
                        <h3>ORB</h3>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These are often called a Seer’s Orb, as this is favored by
                            Wizards of the Occultism Tradition. Orbs are often glass, but those of other materials are
                            not uncommon, though they tend to be precious metals or stones. The only requirement is that
                            they’re larger than your fist. Orbs bend reality, gaining an automatic increase to any
                            spell’s Range by half of its Base Range for every 3 levels of the Wizard.</p>
                        <h3>SPELL BOOK</h3>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"> A large tome, traditionally, the spell book is the favored Medium of the
                            more scholarly magic user.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">The Spell Book is not simply incantations jotted down or notes about
                            rituals - it’s an extension of the Wizard’s brain. As long as he’s touching it, he
                            automatically gains the ability to shape using any Rudiment in the book.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Wizards who select this Weird Medium gain 2 extra starting
                            Rudiments, however, these are only stored in their Book. They also gain a new Rudiment every
                            3 levels, which is also stored there, meaning that if they lose the book, they lose those
                            Rudiments..</p>
                        <h3>SPELL TATTOOS</h3>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"> Painted Men are common in the frozen tundras of Askemark. The metal
                            heavy ink serves to store channeled magic and allows the Wizard to keep invested power for
                            longer.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">With Spell Tattoos, the time it takes to lose a SP when not
                            channeling is doubled for every 4 levels the Wizard has obtained. This also lowers the
                            Stress taken from stopping a spell with SP left by 1 per every 3 levels. </p>
                        <h3>STAVE</h3>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"> Traditionally made of holly wood harvested with a silver sickle at
                            midnight on the night of the new moon, Staves serve as extensions of the Wizard’s soul, much
                            like an Invested Item, but because it’s not made of metal, it holds different properties.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While welding a Stave in one hand, the Wizard offsets the
                            Fallout from casting a spell by 1 every 3 levels the Wizard has obtained. This can't lower
                            it below 0, however, but does extend to the people within 50 ft of them as well.</p>
                        <h3>FAMILIAR</h3>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"> Favored by the traveling Wizard, a familiar is a small animal or
                            homunculus that is bonded to the Wizard’s soul. Because of this connection, a wizard can see
                            and hear through their Familiar’s eyes and ears as well as channel SP through it, as long as
                            it is standing still, allowing the Wizard full movement even when channeling.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">Familiars are small sized creatures. The player selects three candidates,
                            but the GM makes the final decision on which creature came when she called, unless the
                            Wizard opts to have built herself a homunculus.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Wizard who would get 2 Weird Mediums but chooses familiar
                            twice may select a medium or large sized creature or any small sized creature of her choice.
                        </p>
                        <h3>WAND</h3>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"> The Wand is an exact tool, a tool of precision. It is favored by more
                            aggressive spell casters because it makes their spells hard to resist. </p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While casting with a Wand, the Wizard gains a free Stack of one
                            of the spell’s Effect Rudiments for every 3 levels they’ve obtained.</p>

            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The Wizard’s study can sometimes leave her with a divorced relationship to reality
                that can make them somewhat obtuse. When bringing in Traits, Wizards reroll their highest dice roll.

            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Ashcallers receive 2 purchases of the Religion (Ancestors) Advanced Skill
                for free. </p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ANCESTOR COVENANT</strong> The Ashcaller is able to call
                upon the Honorable Dead to effect change in the Middle Realm. They may use any spell from the Animism,
                Calling, and Occultism Traditions with their Honor Dice from Favor behaving like a Channelling Dice.
                They have access to all other Rudiments and may spend Favor normally to modify their surroundings as
                well. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TONGUE OF THE DEAD</strong> Whenever an Ashcaller
                invokes a Miracle and any of the Honor Dice explode, the next Miracle's invocation gives them an
                additional free Honor Dice. This bonus doesn’t stack if multiple dice explode.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HONORING AND HONORED</strong> The Ancestors smile on
                those that strength their legacy. Whenever an Ashcaller gains Honor, they gain an equivalent amount of
                Favor. This can put them over their Max Favor.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ETERNAL FAVOR</strong> An Ashcaller is loved for their
                devotion to their Ancestors beyond others. They add their level to their Max Favor.</p>

                1st level and at every level up.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Ashcallers have turned their back on the Divines and so are unable to invoke
                Miracles that are not directly related to their Covenant.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant

            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CONDUIT OF THE SOUL </strong>The Concert is a vessel for

                between people, is able to strengthen themselves and others.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">A person is considered Soul Linked if the Concert has a Devotion that includes a
                person or vice versa. This can be met with a general Devotion.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">If they met both conditions (both have a Devotion to each other), they’re considered
                Soul Fettered. This doesn’t count if both have a general Devotion to one another: at least one Devotion
                has to be specific to either the Concert or the other person.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ONE BEING </strong>Any Miracle is considered in her
                Covenant when invoked on someone the Concert is Soul Linked to.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">On top of this, if it is someone they’re Soul Fettered with, she gains half the Favor
                (rounded down) spent this way back.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WE'RE ALL FRIENDS </strong>The Concert has a unique
                ability to just chill everyone out and get them to relax, even around age old enemies. If someone who
                she is Soul Linked with is about to be attacked by a sentient foe, before the first blow is actually
                thrown, the Concert can spend 5 Favor to initiate a Conflict to get both sides to back down.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">If it is someone she is Soul Fettered to, she may do this for only 3 Favor.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MUSE </strong>The Concert inspires others to rise to the
                challenge just solely based on her strong belief in them. When starting a Conflict, Combat, or Skill
                Challenge, the Concert receives 2 uses of her Honor Dice that she may give to anyone she is Soul Linked
                to.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">If they are Soul Fettered, that person receives the max value of the dice when they
                redeem them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">She gains an additional Honor Die for every level she’s obtained.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">A Concert’s being is linked to others and so their fates are entwined. If someone who
                is Soul Linked to the Concert dies, they gain 20 Stress each time.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">However, if someone they are Soul Fettered with dies, they gain no extra Vitality and
                no Vitality Die roll on level up. If more than one dies, that subtract 1 for each person from their Max
                Vitality.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant

            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These people take hero worship to another level and by emulating their
                idols, they convince the already shaky reality that they’re the reincarnation of said hero, giving them
                amazing powers. </p>

            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PARAGON’S LEGACY </strong>The Paragon Acolyte can
                channel his hero, allowing him to recreate events from their life on a smaller scale. The player selects
                5 feats that the hero performed during their lifetime and, whenever they invoke Miracles related to one
                or more of those feats, they increase the Honor Dice they get from Favor by 1 size. It is increased an
                additional size for every 4 levels the Paragon Acolyte has obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LIKE STORIES OF OLD </strong>Feeling the power of the
                old stories rush through your veins, it allows you to soar higher than mortals dare. Whenever you roll
                the maximum amount on their Honor Dice, you gain another use of your Honor Die.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MANIFEST DESTINY </strong>Fate is always on the side of
                the hero, then and now. By spending a point of Favor, you can turn one of your Conflict, Skill Check, or
                Defence die to its maximum size. You can do this once at first level and an additional time every 2
                levels.</p>

                their level.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Every hero has a weakness that can lead to their downfall. During character creation,
                the Paragon Acolyte tells the story of the hero’s downfall. When it becomes relevant, the Paragon
                Acolyte cannot spend Honor or Honor Dice to help him.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant

            <h1>PRIEST</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Priests focus on casting Miracles on other people rather than themselves,
                making them a good support Archetype for other classes. Their Miracles vary widely based on their patron
                Divine.</p>

                Priest selects 1 Covenant and 1 Cosmic Link, representing their diety’s sphere of influence and
                personality, respectively.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Covenants change which Miracles the Priest has access to while Cosmic Links change
                the ways you gain and spend Favor.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHEPHERD OF THE PEOPLE</strong>If someone else prays for
                a Miracle within sight of the Priest, the Priest can spend his own Favor to increase the effective cost
                of that Miracle. This ability doesn’t work on those Anointed into other cults. He gains half, rounded
                down, of the Favor spent this way back.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FAVORED OF THE DIVINES</strong> The Priest’s mission
                isn’t a selfish one, but it does have some benefits and they’re loved for their devotion to their

            </p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> A Priest has sworn themselves to a Higher Power and as a token of their Covenant,
                they must select a taboo; an action or thing they must never do, such as cut their hair or eat meat.
                This must be appropriate to the Divine and be approved by the GM before play begins.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant

            <h1>SHAMAN</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A Shaman is one who’s invested their second soul into a Bonfire, thus they
                carry a part of the flame with them where they go. Because of this, others can link into their power and
                stand on hallowed ground where ever they go.</p>

            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">They have been to the womb of creation and back, they gain one free purchase
                of the Lore Skill Suite.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LINKED TO THE BONFIRE </strong>The Shaman has the soul
                of the Bonfire and so is a generator of holy power that flows from them. They increase their Max Favor
                by their level.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">They’re considered part of the Nature, Fire, Fate, and Honor Covenant.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MANTLE of FIRE </strong>The Shaman’s power projects out
                from him so that call can feel it. This is an aura of light that starts out projecting 5 ft form him and
                is increased by 5 ft for every 5 levels they’ve obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">He may temporarily increase the radius using Favor, with 1 Favor expanding it by 5 ft
                though this only lasts 15 seconds.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BURNING GROUND </strong>Wherever a Shaman walks is holy
                ground and those that have no respect for him, find themselves on shaky footing. Enemies within the
                Shaman’s Mantle of Fire reduce their Knock-Back Threshold by 5. This is increased by 5 for every 5
                levels the Shaman has obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WELCOMING HEARTH </strong>Those close to the Shaman,
                both physically and emotionally, find that they too are gifted with the gift of fire. Any friendly
                person standing with the Shaman’s Mantle of Fire also gains the benefits of any Miracle currently
                affecting the Shaman but only when they stand within the Mantle.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SACRIFICE of SOUL </strong>The Shaman can remove their
                mortal coil to manifest their true nature but doing so may kill them. For every 2 Vitality the Shaman
                sacrifices, they gain 1 temporary special Favor. This Favor doesn’t count towards your Current Favor and
                only the Cost when invoking a Miracle. All damage dealt this way goes on one Wound and the Favor is
                wasted if not used before the next sun rise.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">The Shaman may also use this extra Favor to expand his Mantle of Fire.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WARMING SOUL </strong>The Shaman warms the
                souls of others like the fire warms the body. Those around the Shaman heal an additional Stress after a
                day of travel together. This is increased by 1 for every 2 levels the Shaman’s obtained.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">The Shaman literally glows with inner light, giving enemies a +10 to spot them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant Archetype as
                a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double down in this one.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Additionally, when they invoke a Miracle, the Bonfire swells within them,
                making 10 ft around them Bright Illumination. The Shaman is penalized as well if they don’t close their
                eyes, though there’s no permanent damage.</p>
            <h1>SYMBOLIST</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Symbolist is the word and the law, both being sacred to him. His
                worships reality itself and channels the innate power in the corpse of Ymir to shun magic and miracles.
                He grips the law so tightly as to bend it to his will.</p>

            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Being attuned to the beat of the world, Symbolists receive one free purchase
                of the Survival Skill Suite.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LINKED TO THE BONES OF YMIR </strong>Harnessing the
                divine energies of the Middle Realm, the Symbolist is able to become a part of the world in a more real
                way. He gains Favor equal to his Honor Category + 1/2 his level. Unlike other Servants, he can’t gain
                additional Favor through the normal means (sacrifices and holy days): this Favor is static and only
                increases with level.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MARKS of the EARTH </strong>Through ceremony and ritual,
                the Symbolist is able to invoke Miracles that are normally reserved only for the Divines. Given an hour,
                the Symbolist can endow a mark on him or another person. During the ceremony, he selects a certain
                number of his Favor and “locks” into the mark.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Doing so essentially invokes a Miracle on that person, however, unlike a
                normal Miracle, it persists for as long as the person marked wishes it and there is a distinct chance of
                failure: the Symbolist must roll over 10 on their Honor Dice. He gains an additional roll of the Honor
                Dice for every Favor he locks in.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the Miracle is unsuccessfully invoked at the end of the ceremony, the
                mark, and the Miracle by extension, didn’t take and that Favor is freed once more, however, the
                Symbolist can’t try the ceremony again on that person until they increase an Honor Category.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">If it was, that Miracle active, blessing the Symbolist and/or marked person. The mark
                can only be removed at the will of the person or Symbolist and can’t be removed by normal means (so
                washing won’t get rid of it). The Favor is “locked” and can't be used for other marks and Miracles until
                released. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Unlike normal, the Miracle doesn’t give the full Honor Dice as a bonus whenever the
                Miracle is applicable: instead the person gains a +1 (or -1 depending on what the person wants when they
                roll) for each Favor locked into that Miracle when applicable. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Like normal Miracles, however, this can modify things you normally couldn’t,
                like Movement speed or Knock-Back, or what-have-you. The GM may also increase this bonus if he feels it
                is appropriate (getting a +1 to your equipment breaking isn’t that big of a deal so increasing it to +3
                wouldn’t be out of place, for example).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Should the Symbolist die, all his marks are released. Also, should the Symbolist’s
                Favor drop below their currently locked Favor (from lowering an Honor Category, for example) they’re
                forced to unlock one of their marks and dispel a Miracle. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LAW of AVERAGES </strong>The Symbolist is a pillar of
                certainty in a sea of chaos. If the Symbolist rolled under the average on a dice, he may gain 5 Stress
                and the next roll someone makes gives them a +1 bonus to their roll. Additionally, if he rolled over the
                average, he may spend 5 Stress for the next roll to be at a -1 penalty.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">This bonus is also increased by 1 for every 2 levels they’ve obtained and can negate
                perfect attacks and defenses.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CONDUIT OF REALITY </strong>The Symbolist can
                invoke Miracles from the following Covenants: Dream, Guardians, Adversity, Battle, Beauty, Fate, Fire,
                Home, Honor. He is unable to invoke any Miracles outside of these Covenants, even for the normal price.

            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">By anchoring themselves to the Bones of Ymir, the Symbolist cuts off his connection
                to the God’s Realm in a way: other Servants are unable to invoke beneficial Miracles on him and they
                also increase their Honor Dice by 1 size when invoking destructive Miracles on him.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Because of their Anointing, they're also unable to take another Servant
                Archetype as a Secondary, nor are they allowed to double down in this one. Also, due to their inheritant
                link with Ymir, they're unable to take a Caster Archetype as their Secondary. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Socialite Archetypes are people people. They seem to get a real kick out of
                interacting with other; especially if it ends with them getting their way. While other's first weapons
                are sword, a Socialite's first weapon is their charm. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Unsurprisingly, Socialite Archetypes tend to rely on Intellect and
                Charisma.</p>
            <h1>ADVOCATE</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While other Socialites like the limelight, the Advocate doesn’t mind playing
                second fiddle and in fact, thrives there. When supporting others in a Social Conflict, the Advocates
                gets a lot of bonuses.</p>

            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RETHINK AN ARGUMENT </strong>Advocates tend to be more
                introspective than other Socialites, which allows them to wait on an argument until they can articulate
                their thoughts more clearly. When making an Appeal, the Advocate can put aside a number of dice that
                they rolled a 1 on equal to 3 + their level.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">They can later bring it back in, adding it to another round’s total with a +2 for
                every round that dice has sat out. This can bring the total over the dice's maximum value. If you win
                that round, you also put dice added this way into the winning pool, if applicable.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FLANKING POINT </strong>The Advocate can really use his
                unassuming nature to really hammer home a point. If multiple pieces of Evidence is presented in a round
                of a Conflict, and the opposition picks yours to respond to, you gain an additional point.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WALLFLOWER BLOOM </strong>The Advocate really shines
                when not center stage. When making an Appeal, if you roll the least amount of dice (or are tied for it)
                and your side wins the round, gain an additional point.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HELPER'S PORTION </strong>Sometimes the reward
                is just to know you've helped. When the person that started the Conflict is dividing out the Honor, if
                the Advocate takes the least amount, they gain 1 Honor + 1 for every 5 levels they've obtained.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Advocates can kind of lock up when they’re in the driver's seat. When
                they’re the only one in a Social Conflict, Evidence and Appeals give them 1 less point.</p>

            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FORCE OF PERSONALITY </strong>No matter the situation,
                Armigers are able to leverage their likeable personalities. When Rallying a broken person, they may gain
                another use of their Honor Die and an additional Honor Dice for every 2 levels. This additional use of
                the Honor Dice lasts until the end of the Conflict and doesn’t need to be spent right then.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STANDARD </strong>An Armiger has the right to bear a
                heraldic crest that identifies him. He may emblazon this on a banner or his shield, but by having it
                proudly displayed, while he is still fighting, all his allies use his Honor category to determine their
                starting Morale category.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Tactics, 4) </strong>At first
                level and every level up, Armigers receive 4 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any
                Advanced Skills from the Tactics Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same
                level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Armigers are standards of the people and when they fail to live up to that,
                they’re judged more harshly. If the Armiger is forced to retreat from a Combat or Conflict for any
                reason, they lose 5 Honor.</p>

            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>POWER OF DEVOTION </strong>Zeal is a powerful force and
                can sharpen the mind and bring out the best in someone when properly channelled. Whenever redeeming an
                Honor Die while doing something related to their Devotion, they also add that Devotion to the roll.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FANATICAL PRESENCE </strong>Your oath is sacred and only
                death can prevent you from the fulfilment of your duty and others can see that. This total faith in your
                path makes the going easier for others. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">During a Morale Conflict that relates to the Champion’s Devotion, whenever an
                argument involves him, one of those dice gets a +1. This is increased by 1 for every level you’ve
                obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Multiple Devotions don’t stack in this case. You may add this bonus regardless of
                whether or not you're the party captain and anyone on the Champion’s side is eligible for this benefit.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SOLEMNITY OF CAUSE </strong>A Champion considers his
                obligations with a solemn contemplation and as his beliefs are challenged, the stronger they grow. If he
                rolls at least two 1s on his Repercussions from a Social Conflict where one of his Devotions was
                involved, he may increase the size of one of that Devotion for free in addition to his other choice of
                benefit.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IRON RESOLVE </strong>Nothing, not even apparent defeat,
                can sway a Champion from their course of action. In a Conflict that is related to at least one of their
                Devotions, when the Champion loses an Appeal, they gain a +1 to their next round if they Appeal again.
                This is increased by 1 for every 3 levels they've obtained. they </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Those on his side are also bolstered by this surety and gain the same bonus

            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Champions take their oaths very seriously and don’t take new ones on lightly. When
                rolling Repercussions, a Champion may only choose “Gain a Devotion” if he rolled a number of 1s greater
                than or equal to the number of Devotion he already has. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Anytime they can purchase Devotions for CrP, the price of a new Devotion is

            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CAREFUL WORDING</strong> A Diplomat has the grace and
                tact to be able to reword an argument in the most effective way possible. The Diplomat can spend 10
                Stress to reroll all of the dice for one side when they Appeal in a Social Conflict. For his and his
                allies’ Characteristics, take the higher of the two results. For the enemy, take the lower of the two
                results.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STRONG PERSONALITY</strong> As a Diplomat grows, she
                becomes more confident in who she is and what she wants. At 2nd level and every other level after that,
                a Diplomat can increase the strength of one of their Traits by 1 dice (up to a d20) or they save them
                and cash in two of these increases for a new weak Trait starting at 1d4.</p>

                They gain an additional free Honor Die for every level they’ve obtained. They can only apply 1 of these
                bonus Honor Dice to a single roll, though that doesn’t stop them adding Honor Dice that they got from
                other sources.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RESILIENT CHARACTER</strong> Surprisingly,
                those with the strongest personalities have the greatest power to resist abuse and not second guess
                themselves. When using an Appeal, shrink the Repercussion Dice by 1 size.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Diplomats put their reputation on the table whenever they engage in Social

            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Foil focuses on using the other person when convincing them of
                something. He can steal the opponent’s dice in Social Conflict and when things get tough, he can tag in
                another person to take on the Conflict.</p>

            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MIRRORING</strong> By agreeing with your enemy, you can
                sometimes lull them into a false sense of security, causing them to lower their guard. A Foil can take
                15 Stress and make a guess at a Characteristic his opponent has. If he’s correct, that Characteristic
                loses 1 dice for every 2 levels he’s obtained, down to 1 dice. He also automatically receives points
                equal to the dice removed.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">So a level 7 Foil who correctly guesses a 3d6! characteristic, lowers it to d6! and
                gains 2 points.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GASLIGHTING</strong> A Foil’s particularly devious when
                it comes to other’s flaws and weaknesses. A Foil can guess a character’s Mental or Behavioral Flaw. If
                correct, and they successfully use it in an Appeal, they gain an additional point.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CONTEMPT</strong> A Foil can pretend he doesn't care,
                thus shaking his opponent's confidence in their arguments. If a Foil starts the round, Appeals, and
                loses, they can take 10 Stress. If they do, they gain half the points they would have gotten if they has
                succeeded. They reduce the Stress inflicted by 1 for every 4 levels they've obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHIFT BLAME</strong> There’s strength in
                numbers, especially when those numbers are used as a shield. When his side makes a successful Appeal,
                the Foil can sacrifice 1 Honor to choose who’s dice gets added as points instead of going with the
                lowest. That person, however, is thrown head first into a stressful situation, suddenly becoming the
                center of attention, giving them 3 Stress for every point of difference between what they’re added and
                what would have been added. This penalty is lowered by 1 Stress for every 10 levels the Foil has
                obtained.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Foils are so good at mirroring others that they often forget to reflect on
                themselves. They only gain positive benefits from social Repercussions if they roll two natural 1s. </p>

            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>OF LEAD & POWDER </strong>A Fusilier trains with guns,
                pushing their skills to the limit, allowing to get creative in their uses. Fusiliers may wield and fire
                handgonnes with one hand and count as small weapons for the 2 1 Handed Weapons Style. They’re also able
                to deploy a hakenbuchse’s trip pod in 2 seconds instead of 5 seconds and they get 2 uses out of each
                fire lance.</p>

            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Due to all the gunfire a Fusilier has been around, they have a harder time
                hearing than others. The Listening Advanced Skill costs 6 CrP instead of 4.</p>

            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Knave is a mean villain - mean in the sense of being crude and villian
                in the sense of being low class, but unlike others, the Knave doesn’t seem to mind and that’s where

                Honor for the sake of not having people talk bad about them, the Knave doesn’t care and so she can use
                her as a weapon. A Knave can lose 3 Honor to increase all her Characteristic dice by 1 and reroll all
                non-exploded dice she’s using in her Appeal that round. She can also increase 1 extra dice by 1 size for

                dice by X sizes for everyone in that round (including the Knave and her allies). This follows the normal
                rules if a Characteristic would drop below a d4!, however, the Knave’s never drop below 1d4!.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This ability shrinks a single dice an additional size for every 2 levels

                Shrink their Honor Dice by 1 size.</p>

            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Monteback is one of tricks and quick thinking. He relies on dazing the
                person with words, hoping they won’t take the time to catch onto his tricks.</p>

            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FAST TALKER </strong>If you can get someone to agree
                quickly, so much the better. You start the Conflict gaining an additional d8! but shrinks one size each
                round, down to a d4!. You gain an additional dice for every 2 levels you've obtained. You only get this
                bonus if you choose to Appeal that round. The dice shrinks even if you use Evidence that round.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">However, if you’re unable to convince your target by that time, the next round you
                receive no bonus dice from this ability and each round after, you instead reduce the size of one of your
                dice if you Appeal.</p>

                dice they gain from their Skills by 1 size.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>KEEP 'EM OFF BALANCE </strong>The Monteback knows how to
                make a mark sweat and uses that pressure to have them start making rash decisions in his favor. If your
                opponents gain a Repercussion dice, they roll it instantly. They gain the Stress immediately though Long
                Term Repercussions are still held till after the Conflict.</p>

                level and every level up, Montebacks receive 4 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between
                any Advanced Skills from the Streetwise Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in
                the same level but are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Monteback is the devil in disguise and his untrustworthy nature makes
                him never quite sure if you can trust him. You lower everyone’s Racial Preference towards you by 1,
                bottoming out at Hate.</p>

            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Noble is typically aloof and hard to impress and so can convince people
                simply by making them unsure about their conviction, shrinking their dice in Social Conflict. </p>

            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NOBLE BEARING</strong> By reminding others of their
                lower station in life, you can remind them just how petty their needs are. You inflict 1 point of Stress

            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ROYAL BACKGROUND</strong> Nobles form an elite class of
                society, giving them a strong sense of self and confidence. Their Devotion to their clan starts at a
                1d10! and they gain the Trait “Noble Heritage” at 3d6! for free. This doesn't replace any of their 6
                free Traits and may be increased in the normal matter.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GOOD BREEDING</strong> In victory or defeat, the Noble
                is gracious. At the end of a Conflict, the Noble receives 1 Honor automatically. This bonus is increased
                by 1 Honor for every 2 levels he’s obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">All his allies also automatically gain 1 Honor, though this doesn’t increase as the
                Noble levels.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INHERITANCE</strong> This character may have
                had an extra leg up in life, allowing them the opportunity to start with better equipment than others.
                They gain a free weapon of their choice or a Courser mount and also gain 15 sc for each CrP cashed in at
                the end of Character Creation.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Noblity is a collective illusion and so those of royal blood, no matter how
                limited strive to keep that illusion in place. Nobles lose 1 Honor and gain 1 Stress whenever they're
                not referred to by either their proper title, "my lord", or "sir". </p>

            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ESPRIT de CORPS </strong>The Officer can push others to
                limits they didn’t know they had in them to fight for their comrades. At first level, while the Officer
                is conscious, any ally that can see him gains a positive Devotion to the company starting at strength 1.
                This is increased by 1 for every level he’s obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BATTLEFIELD MANEUVERING </strong>Careful planning and
                strategic movement can help win over the day. The Officer can sacrifice an Honor Die to allow anyone on
                the battlefield to either switch Tactics or Shift without a penalty at that second. This can be done
                after a roll is made and the results given and the Officer can either sacrifice his Honor Die or one
                that the person who is benefiting from this ability has.</p>

            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Officers don’t really know how to fight alone and may take the better part
                of valor in a combat. When fighting alone, Officer characters gain 1 Stress everytime they put up dice
                in a Morale Conflict.</p>
            <h1>PHILOSOPHER</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Philosopher reserves his strength, allowing his opponent in a Conflict
                to escalate for him. While others suffer strain from not meeting the argument straight on, the
                Philosopher uses it to his advantage.</p>

            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RHETORIC</strong> By knowing the fundamentals of how to
                form an argument, a Philosopher can stop and point out the logical fallacies in another’s argument (even
                if they’re not there). A Philosopher can flip a dice over one side, to a lower number. They can flip an
                additional dice for every level they’ve obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">So, they can move a 7 on a d10 to 5, 3, 2, but not 10, or a 6 on a d12 to a 2 or 3
                but not up to 8, 9, or 12.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STOIC</strong> Philosophers are trained so that petty
                things like emotion arguments don’t have as strong an effect on them and their opponent can tell. If a
                Philosopher uses Evidence against an opponent's Appeal or his opponent Appeals and he responds with
                Evidence, he gains 1 point.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CLOSING REMARKS</strong> Regardless of whether they want
                to hear it or not, the Philosopher knows how to make you listen. Whenever a Philosopher pushes, he gains
                1 point.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PRACTICE DEBATE</strong> Even if you don’t get
                what you want, you can often get practice for next time. Whenever a Philosopher loses a Social Conflict,
                they gain 1 use of their Honor Die in their next Conflict. This increases by 1 use for every other level
                they obtain, however, they can’t use more than 1 per round.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Philosopher tries to not let things get personal: when they make an
                Appeal, increase their Repercussions dice by 1 size.</p>
            <h1>RASCAL</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Rascal gains a few skills but their main strength is their cunning
                ability to avert danger, though any brush with death leaves him shaken. On top of this, in Social
                Conflict, the Rascal wins because he can leverage circumstances in his favor.</p>

            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LUCKY </strong> The Rascal is naturally blessed
                with the ability to get out of trouble and use that adrenaline that comes as death comes near to dodge
                the grim reaper and keep running. After the results are given, the Rascal can take 2 Stress to modify
                his results by 1. These may be done with the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They can never be used to make you a better fighter. Stress gained this way can only be used to
                    dodge death or escape a bad situation but never to make your character a superman. </li>
                <li>The character must think of a situation that saves his rear end, something that happens to him
                    that’s to his advantage. </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin:0px;">The key here is that it can’t be impossible but it can be highly improbable. The
                chandelier rope breaking right at that moment separating him from a blood thirsty guard, a pigeon flying
                across an archer’s view intercepting an arrow, etc. are all acceptable.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">It can’t be the result of skill. Him deflecting the blade with his hand like a badass
                is right out.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Should the character be unable to think of a scenario that fits both of these
                criteria, he’s unable to gain Stress to save himself.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GREASE PAINT & GLITTER</strong> If there's one thing
                that a Rascal knows, it’s how to position themselves in the most advantageous light. In a Conflict, once
                per round, the Rascal increases one dice 1 size. This is increased to by 1 for every level he’s
                obtained. This can either be his or his allies’, it doesn’t matter.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Once he’s increased all dice in a round 1 size, he may then go back and increase them
                again, and so on.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Any, 2)</strong> At first level
                and every level other up, Rascals receive 2 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any
                Advanced Skill. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but are applied after
                Skills have been bought by the Character.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Rascal favors no weapons as they tend to get you killed: all Weapon
                Advanced Trainings are 2 CrP more expensive per Tier (Tier 1: 10 CrP, Tier 3: 22 CrP).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> War is a ladder by which capable people are able to climb the ranks of society.
                Fighter Archetypes focus on combat and battle, either by training and discipline or by out maneuvering
                their opponent.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Unsurprisingly, these Archetypes focus on Constitution, but how you
                approach combat may decide whether you favor Strength, Dexterity, or even Intellect or Wisdom. </p>

            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">“Barbarian” is often a derogatory term used by people who consider

                Trainings, 1 for a 2 handed weapon, a ranged weapon, and small weapon</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ADVANCED TACTICS </strong>A Barbarian is a skirmisher
                and doesn’t rely on formalized training methods like other fighters. As such, their greatest strength is
                the utilization of Tactics. At 1st level and at every 2nd level after that, a Barbarian can increase the
                bonus or lower the penalty for a Tactic by 1, though they can never make a penalty a bonus nor go beyond
                double a bonus’s original amount. So, the max you can get the Faint to is +10 to Attack and +0 to your
                Defense.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">This doesn't remove requirements (such as moving) or special penalties (such as
                dealing half damaged while Feinting against people who Step Back or Retreat). </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRIBAL WEAPONRY </strong>Trained from birth with tribal
                weapons, the Barbarian thinks of disparate weapons all as extensions of his arm. At 1st level, the
                Barbarian picks a 2 handed weapon, a ranged weapon, and a small weapon. All these weapons are considered
                1 group: any Mastery purchased for one of them is applied to every other weapon. They’re considered Tier
                2 for price.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CONSTANT VIGILANCE </strong>Pay attention or end up as
                monster chow. Everyone receives a -1 to their Initiative for every 5 levels the Barbarian has obtained
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ENDURANCE TRAINING </strong>A Barbarian is used
                to running and jumping for hours on end and gain a -1 to their Encumbrance for every 2 levels obtained.
            </p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Barbarians haven’t benefited fully from the learning of more advanced
                civilizations. All Skills with Int as a relevant ability cost 2 CrP more.</p>
            <h1>BERSERKER </h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Berserker is a child of war, often raised from an early age in the most
                punishing conditions to harden them. In battle they fly into a primal rage, craving through enemies like
                warm butter. </p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">higher of 2d12</p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Berserkers receive no skills but they do receive 1 Weapon Basic Training and
                the Aggressive Fighter Mastery for free.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PAIN TOLERANT </strong>The Berserker has learned to
                simply overpower his pain sensors and keep fighting. At 1st level, he gains a - 3 bonus to his Trauma
                check. This increased by 1 for every 2 levels he's obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SCARIFICATION </strong>For every battle and victim, the
                Berserker scars himself to commemorate his victory. Over time, these scars serve as armor as his skin
                hardens. The Berserker gains 1 DR at first level and for every 4 levels obtained. Against a weapon, use
                whichever is highest (whether it’s the /D or static DR). This ability does stack with armor but the
                scars chaff and rub, so double any penalties gained from wearing it.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">This scarification is unsettling to look upon. The Berserker also gains a 2d8 Trait
                “Intimidating Presence” because of them. This is separate from the Trait “Battle Scars”.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BATTLE FRENZY </strong>These warriors are able to drive
                themselves into a crazed frenzy, giving them almost supernatural abilities. While in a Battle Frenzy,
                the Berserker doubles his bonuses from Pain Tolerant and Scarification and makes them temporarily immune
                to penalties from Stress, though they still gain Stress from Wounds as per normal.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">The DR granted from Scarification also applies to the damage dealt by Running and
                Sprinting, however, it is effectively halved for Sprinting.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">On top of this, whenever they kill an opponent, they heal an amount of damage equal
                to the amount under 0 he puts them. So, a Berserker deals 10 damage to a person with 6 Vitality left,
                bringing the enemy to -4 and healing the Berserker 4 Vitality. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Battle Frenzy increases as the warrior nears death. When a Berserker is
                Hurt they gain an additional dice of damage equal to their Honor Die and when Wounded they gain another.
                This doesn't increase the effective dice number.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There are drawbacks to the Frenzy. The first is that the Berserker can take
                no defensive actions. This includes any defensive Tactics but also prevents him from actively crouching
                behind his shield for cover or Taking a Breather and, when doing aggressive actions, they are less
                careful, doubling their penalties from the same. Additionally, there is a price to pay for driving your
                body for so long; when you drop out of the Frenzy, you take enough damage, on one Wound, to drop you
                another Vitality Category. You also gain no benefits from Taking a Breather after doing so until you
                drop another Vitality Category (so you can't just heal it back up, sorry). </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">This Frenzy is awoken by the Berserker and takes 3d6 seconds to get into, during
                which time the Berserker beats his chest, screams at the sky, and just generally psyches himself up. The
                more wounded the Berserker becomes, however, the easier it is to get into the right frame of mind, so
                remove a d6 for every Vitality Category he has dropped. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHARED FRENZY </strong>Some of the manic power
                the Berserker commands overflows and invigorates his allies. Those on the Berserker’s side can Run for
                an additional 3 seconds per Berserker level and can Sprint an additional 1 second per Berserker level.
            </p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Berserkers are killers and can sometimes get lost in the glory of battle.
                After downing every foe on the battlefield, they need to make a Wisdom check. On a failure, they’re
                unable to calm down and attack the nearest person, friendly or not. After every attack they make, they
                can make another Wis check to try and snap out of it. Failure indicates they keep attacking.</p>
            <h1>BRAWLER</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">On the streets or in the arena, you’ll find the Brawler, battling it out.
                For the joy of throwing their opponents around like a rag doll, they fight. Brawlers are unarmed
                fighters primarily, eager to toss anyone that opposes them aside.</p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">d12 </p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Brawlers receive 1 free purchase of the Streetwise Skill Suite.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>REGISTERED WEAPONS </strong>The Brawler knows how to
                appear like a threat, even when unarmed. They always count as having a weapon for Weapon Style.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IMPROVED ADVANCED TRAINING </strong>Brawlers train to be
                deadly artists with their fists and soon gain a knack for it. For Brawlers, Tier 1 Unarmed Advanced
                Training has a Base Cost of 5.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MARTIAL TRAINING </strong>A Brawler receives a free
                Weapon Advanced Training for Unarmed Combat for every level he’s obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>OPPORTUNISTIC FIGHTER </strong>Part of being a
                streetfighter is seizing every chance you get to get ahead. A Brawler and his allies score a Near
                Perfect Attack and Defense on a roll of 18 and 19.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IMMOVABLE </strong>By planting yourself and
                watching your structure, you can really push people around. You gain an effective + 1 to your Vitality
                Size Modifier for Knock Backs. On top of this, you lower your enemy's Vitality Size Modifier by 1 for
                Knock Backs as well. This bonus increased by 1 every level.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Something about being a Brawler makes them shun weapons where they can’t get
                up and personal with their opponent. Ranged Weapon Advanced Trainings cost 2 CrP more.</p>
            <h1>CATERAN</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Cateran is all about flanking your opponent and keeping other fighters
                locked down. As such, they work best with other fighters.</p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d8</p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Caterans receives the Deadly Flanker Mastery, as well as free Light Armor
                Basic Training and 1 Weapon Basic Training.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BABY-SITTING</strong> While an individual Cateran may
                vary in his ability to take care of infants, they all share the ability to keep combatants locked down.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Whenever a person engaged with the Cateran tries to disengage, the Cateran gets an
                immediate free attack that, if it hits, deals half damage. This happens regardless of where they are on
                the Clock and doesn’t effect when their next attack happens. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CLOSED OPENINGS</strong> Flanking is the art of dividing
                people’s attention and the Cateran has perfected that art. Anyone flanked by a Cateran lowers their
                attack die by 1 size, regardless of who they’re attacking.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MUTIEREN</strong> A Cateran knows to move their blade to
                get into places their opponents wouldn't expect. If facing an enemy who's weapon has a base Parry or who
                is carrying a shield, the Cateran recieves a +1 to Attack +1 for every 2 levels they've obtained. This
                ability isn't effective against people who gained their Parry solely through training.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHADOWING</strong> By keeping close to their opponent,
                the Cateran can negate people’s defensive posturing. By taking 15 Stress, a Cateran can negate any
                bonuses an opponent gets from moving, whether that’s shifting, stepping back, or whatever and also stops
                their opponent from moving. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The Cateran can do this as many times as they want but the Stress cost doubles each
                time they do so, though this resets once they’ve had time to destress. Also, this Stress cost is lowered
                by 1 for every 2 levels they’ve obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BUM RUSH</strong> A Cateran can also use his
                allies to more effectively flank their opponents. The Cateran can give any other allies flanking the
                same enemy the benefits of the Deadly Flank Mastery if they don’t have it.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Cateran is a group fighter and fighting alone can be unnerving for him.
                When engaged with enemies alone and not flanking, the Cateran is unable to use his Honor.</p>
            <h1>MAN-AT-ARMS</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Man-at-Arms uses his own know-how against his opponents. She gets more
                deadly the more Masteries she gains. With this she can adapt to who she is fighting where others can’t.
            </p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d10</p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Man-at-Arms receive 1 free purchase of the Athletics Skill Suite. They
                also receive 3 free Weapon Basic Training Masteries.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>KNOW YOUR ENEMY</strong> A Man-at-Arms is good at using
                watching her foe and exploiting weaknesses. For every 20 seconds she is either Threatening someone or
                someone is Threatening her, she gains a cumulative bonus to Attack, Defense, Recovery, or Damage. This
                bonus, and what she can choose to apply it to is based on her Advanced Weapon Basic Training.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Tier 4 gives her a +1, Tier 3 gives her a +2, and Tier 2 and under give her a +3.
                She can only apply this bonus to a metric she has an Advanced Training Bonus in. So, for example, if she
                is fighting someone with a slashing sword and she has a +1 to Attack and Defense with all Slashing
                weapons (Tier 3), that means, for every 20 seconds she is fighting that person, she can add an
                additional +2 to her Attack or Defense. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> This bonus is applied to one metric per person and everything reset should that foe
                become completely unengaged wit her. So, if the Man-At-Arms is Threatening two foes for 20 seconds, she
                can apply her bonus to attacking one, while the other bonus goes to defending against another. If one
                she is defending against leaves, she has to continue applying her bonus to attacking the other. Should
                that foe threaten her again, she gains no bonuses again him but can change to attacking him as well.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The time it takes to accure this bonus is lowered 1 second for level the Men-at-Arms
                obtains, down to a minimum 1 second. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COUNTING COUP</strong> Part of being a Man-at-Arms is
                keeping a reputation for your skill in combat and this can often become a game that everyone gets caught
                up in. If you give yourself a penalty to Attack, you gain 1 Honor and gain Relaxation equal to that
                penalty if you score a hit. If you've already used this ability once this Combat, your allies may do so
                as well, gaining an additional point of Relaxation (but not Honor) for each teammate who's successfully
                couted coup before them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MARTIAL TRAINING </strong>A Man-at-Arms receives his
                choice of a free Tier 3 or 4 Armor, Shield, or Weapon Advanced Training for every levels he's obtained.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IMPROVED ADVANCED TRAINING</strong> A
                Man-at-Arms studies the greatest weapon, armor, and shield techniques to pick them up easier. For them,

                Tier 4 a Base Cost of 10.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Men-at-Arms fight and when they lose, it’s hard on them: they lose 5 Honor
                for every combat they’re knocked unconscious or fail a Trauma check in due to humiliation.</p>
            <h1>KNIGHT</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Knight focuses on shield and armor, and with their larger Vitality Die,

                spread confusion and disorientation that can limit an enemy’s ability to respond. Whenever the
                Skirmisher hits a surprised enemy, that enemy receives -2 to Attack and Defense for the next 7 seconds.
                Additionally, should they move above a Walk during this time, they gain an additional -2 for each
                Movement Category above such for that duration. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COMBAT READY</strong> A Skirmisher is ready to go at any
                time. They lower their Initiative Dice down by 1 size per level they’ve obtained, down to a d2. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GUERILLA FIGHTING</strong> Skirmishers are masters at
                getting in, doing some damage, and getting out, causing confusion as they move. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">If someone attacks the Skirmisher while she is at a Jog or higher, or misses an
                attack when she disengages with someone, the enemy is left open for two seconds. If hit within that
                window, then the enemy receives a -3 to Attack for 7 seconds + 1 every level.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RAID TACTICS</strong> Confusion allows those to
                dart in and out, dealing terrible damage. While receiving penalties from the Skirmisher, enemies are
                unable to capitalize and get no free attacks when someone disengaged with them.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Skirmisher moves and so quickly loses her edge when pinned down. She
                receives a -2 for every 5 seconds she hasn’t moved at least 5 ft in combat.</p>
            <h1>SOLDIER</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Bonfire character are not meant to stand alone and this goes double for the
                Soldier, who work the best with others. They’re able to shadow others around the battlefield and really
                focus on being good at one or two weapons.</p>

            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Soldiers receive 1 free purchase of the Tactics Skill Suite.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Soldiers receive either the Armor Basic Training (Light) and Shield Basic
                Training or Armor Training (Medium). On top of this, they gain 1 Weapon Basic Training Mastery for free
                as well.</p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SMALL UNIT TACTICS</strong> Soldiers work as a team. If
                they or anyone they’re adjacent uses a tactic that moves them (Shift, Step Back, etc.), the Soldier or
                their adjacent ally may also use that Tactic with no penalties.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IMPROVED ADVANCED TRAINING</strong> Soldiers rely on
                others to make up for their weaknesses, as such, that gives them greater freedom to really specialize in
                what they’re good at. For Soldiers Tier 1 Weapon Advanced Training have a Base Cost of 6.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BUDDY SYSTEM</strong> Soldiers fight as a unit, moving
                and acting as one where possible. When an adjacent ally switches Tactics, the Soldier may immediately
                switch to that Tactic as well. On top of this, they also receive a -1 bonus to their Trauma checks,
                which increased by 1 for every level the soldier has obtained</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MARTIAL TRAINING</strong> A Soldier receives a
                free Tier 1 Weapon Advanced Training for every level he’s obtained. </p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Soldier focuses so much time drilling with his preferred weapon that he
                can often forget that principles with one weapon can apply to another. All Tier 4 and above Weapon
                Advanced Trainings are 2 CrP more expensive. </p>
            <h1>TACTICIAN</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Tactician is a jack of all trades but master of none, focusing on being
                slightly less skilled at a multitude of weapons. This means that the Tactician will probably have the
                right weapon for the right enemy. On top of this, the Tactician is skilled at the use of Combat Tactics
                (hence the name) which allows them to seize opening that others can’t. Overall, the Tactician focuses on
                versatility.</p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d8</p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Tacticians receive 1 free purchase of the Tactics Skill Suite.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Tacticians receive the Armor Basic Training (Medium) Mastery and 2 Weapon
                Basic Trainings for free. </p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>QUICK OR DEAD</strong> A Tactician lives on his wits.
                While others rely on training, he works on instinct and so can often take advantage of situations that
                others can’t. By taking 15 Stress, this ability allows the Tactician to change his Combat Tactic or
                Weapon Style, regardless of where he is on the Clock or whether or not the dice have been rolled. He
                must qualify for the Tactic to use it (so he can’t suddenly Charge if he’s not already at a Run). You
                can use this ability multiple times, however its Stress price doubles each time you do it between
                periods of Relaxation, but the Stress it inflicts is lowered by 1 for every 2 levels you’ve obtained.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SECOND WIND</strong> Find the perfect time rest is what
                the Tactician is all about; he gains 1 additional Vitality for every level he's obtained when he Takes a
                Breather.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">He also knows how to properly cover people when they’re trying to rest. If he is
                within his Measure + 5 ft of an ally, they gain 1 additional Vitality for every 2 levels he’s obtained
                when Taking a Breather.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL FOCUS (Tactics, 4)</strong> At first level and
                every level up, Tacticians receive 4 free skill purchases. These can be distributed between any Advanced
                Skill from the Tactics Skill Suite. These free purchases may not be doubled up on in the same level but
                are applied after Skills have been bought by the Character. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL ADEPT</strong> This character has a knack
                for skills. All Advanced Skills have their cost reduced by 1 CrP. They also gain a 10% discount to all
                Skill Suites. This stacks with other Skill Adepts.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A Tactician focuses so much on being versatile that their specific
                specialization suffers. All Tier 1 Weapon Advanced Trainings costs 4 CrP more.</p>
            <h1>THUG</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Thug is designed to hit hard and make each strike count. As such they
                have abilities that remove an enemy’s damage reduction and increase the chance to knock someone out.</p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d6</p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Thugs receive 2 free purchase of the Streetwise Skill Suite.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thugs receive the Armor Basic Training (Light) Mastery and 1 Weapon Basic
                Training for free. </p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CRITICAL STRIKE</strong> If you deal enough damage to
                move your opponent into the next Wound Category, you trigger a Trauma check with the target rolling a
                d12!, instead of a d20.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RUN 'EM RAGGED</strong> At the beginning of combat, the
                Thug gains a pool of Stress equal to 10 times his level. On a successfully hit, he may substract an
                amount of Stress from that pool. If he does so, he inflicts that much Stress on his target, which is
                healed when the person Takes a Breather.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PRECISION ATTACK</strong> The Thug is an expert at
                making every attack count, he lowers the DR of his opponent by 1 per 2 levels. For /d DR, this is
                subtracted from the final total. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Example, a level 12 Thug with a dagger (3 dice) vs Scale (2/D), would
                reduce the enemy’s DR to 4 (6 total DR - 2 from Precision Attack), while one using a club (1 dice) would
                reduce it to 0 (2 total DR - 2 from Precision Attack). </p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Thug never really rises above his street rat origins: the Leadership,
                Administration, Rally, and Recruiting Advanced Skills all cost double. </p>
            <h1>VANGUARD</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Vanguard is the first in the fray, usually engaging multiple enemies at
                the same time and trying to do as much damage as possible to soften them up for their allies to follow.
            </p>
            <h3>VITALITY DIE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d10</p>
            <h3>SKILLS & MASTERIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Vanguards receive 1 free purchase of the Tactics Skill Suite.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also receive the Armor Basic Training (Medium) Training and 1 Weapon
                Basic Training for free. </p>
            <h3>ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AGAINST THEM ALL</strong> When they’re in the thick of
                it is when the Vanguard thrives. The Vanguard gains their Honor Dice to their Attack rolls against 1
                opponent when engaged with 2 or more enemies.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IN & OUT & AROUND</strong> Knowing how to slip and out
                of your opponent’s guards allow the Vanguard to get in and out of a jam quickly.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> By gaining 15 Stress, the Vanguard may change their engagement zone with one
                opponent, without any associated penalties.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> So, if they’re Threatening their opponent, they could move to Engaged or they could
                move themselves out to Not Engaged without giving their enemy that free attack.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, if their enemy has successfully employed the In Their Guard Tactic,
                the Vanguard can move them back out to simply Engaged.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> They can do this multiple times by doubling the Stress gain each time it’s used.
                This resets after they’ve been able to gain destress. This penalty is also reduced by 1 for every 2
                levels the Vanguard has obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CROWD CONTROL</strong> Surrounded by enemies, the
                Vanguard learns to use the crowd against themselves, forcing his enemies to get in each other’s way.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> A Vanguard can use his full defense against an additional opponent if the two
                opponents are adjacent to each other and, should anyone try to disengage with him, he may take 5 Stress,
                in which case, he gains a free attack against them although this is at half damage.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FIRST STRIKE</strong> The Vanguard hits hard and hits
                first. Or at least, they try to.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> At the beginning of combat, Vanguards receive a pool of Measure equal to 1 ft + 1
                per every level they’ve obtained. When they first become Engaged with an opponent, they may spend ft
                from that pool to temporarily increase their Measure to determine who strikes first.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> So, a level 6 Vanguard would have a pool of 4 ft to work with. If wielding a
                Stiletto (Measure 1.5 ft) and closing in to Engage with an enemy wielding a Rapier (Measure 4 ft), he
                could spend 3 ft of it to allow him to get his hit off first, perhaps crippling his enemy before they
                have change to respond. Doing so would leave him with 1 ft in his pool for the rest of combat.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After that, combat resumes as normal, so he wouldn’t be able to attack the
                Rapier wielder if he is being Fended Off.</p>
            <h3>PRIMARY DRAWBACK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Vanguards are a position of Honor and they don’t take charging into battle
                lightly. A Vanguard loses 1 Honor for every battle they’re not the first on either side to land a melee
                attack.</p>
            <h5>Flaws</h5>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Every person have flaws; little quirks of their personality or odd
                behaviors. These flaws are often a way of dealing with troubles in their life, letting off Stress or
                rationalizing their behavior to others. Other times they’re artifacts of a hard life, like a soldier
                who’s missing an arm. </p>
            <h1>BENEFITS & PENALTIES</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Flaws in Bonfire are a trade off: they’ll make your character less able to
                do things in certain arenas or harder to be around but allow you to invest in abilities and powers
                elsewhere. This is represented by the CrP bonus that you get from taking Flaws</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Another bonus is that by overcoming a character's Flaws, a person gains
                confidence and Honor. Essentially, this means by applying your Flaws to your detriment, your character
                becomes stronger. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is done very simply by saying that you think a Flaw would make
                something harder for your character in this situation and then giving yourself a -d4! to your Skill,
                Attack, or Defense roll or giving your opponent d4! Leverage. Regardless of whether or not you succeed,
                they gain Honor equal to your penalty. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The GM may award more Honor or inflict you with a larger penalty as seems
                appropriate for the situation. After all, if it's something your character really struggles with and it
                gives them a -d8!, it makes sense that they would get an equivalent amount of Honor for overcoming the
                challenge. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, note that if you're the one to bring up your Flaws, you get Honor
                regardless but if the GM has to do so, you only get Honor if you succeed so it is always better to bring
                them up yourself (unless you have a very inattentive GM). </p>
            <h1>GAINING FLAWS</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are two ways to select Flaws: Rolling and Cherry Picking. Rolling
                gives you more CrP per Flaw but Cherry Picking gives you more control. </p>

            <p style="margin:0px;"> For the roleplayers among us with a specific character idea in mind, you may Cherry
                Pick your Flaws. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each Flaw loses 10 CrP of it’s value per Flaw to a minimum of 0 CrP
                received. So, the 3rd Flaw you pick will be at a -30 CrP.</p>
            <h1>FLAW DESCRIPTIONS</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While most Flaws can be reasonably looked up, some might need some
                clarification which is why they're listed below or additional penalties. We've also provided some handy
                tables you might find useful for figuring out the details of that Flaw. </p>

            <h3>ATHEIST</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The way of the divine is a mysterious path and someone mistake it for no
                path at all. Some refuse to believe that intelligent higher powers exist and so forfeit some of the
                blessings while others find worshipping such beings laughable, like giving reverence to the biggest
                bully on the block.</p>
            <h3>BLIND, TOTAL</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> This character has completely lost his sight. He sees only pure white or pure black,
                unable to sense any movement around him.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> In melee combat, they defend and attack with a 1d6! And ranged combat is right out,
                however, if you insist, you’ll be attacking with a 1d4, so enjoy your fumbles, you stubborn bastard.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Additionally, any Skill Challenges involving sight halves the person’s
                Skill Rank.</p>
            <h3>BOAR FACED</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is the polite way of say that someone is ugly as sin. This could be
                the result of parentage or a bad accident, either way, people don’t like being around them or dealing
                with them. As mean as it might be, people judge books by their covers.</p>
            <h3>DARK SECRET</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There’s something that this character is hiding and she’s worried that
                she’ll be found out. She’ll jealously guard every aspect of her life if she can for fear of being found
                out.</p>
            <h3>DEBTOR</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has gotten into trouble financially. This character starts
                with 5d20 + 150 sc of debt instead of gaining a like amount to start off with. All their equipment much
                then be purchased on a credit of 50 sc that is also taken out of their debt. If they don’t make payments
                on it, they may find themselves on the bad end of the law or the loan shark they borrowed from.</p>
            <h3>DERANGED</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> There’s holes in this character’s brains and he’s starting to slip into madness. The
                nature of this neurosis is up to the character.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The character doesn’t suffer the effects of Stress until it matches his
                Wisdom score, at that point, he has an episode and doubles his total Stress. Once, he’s recovered
                (dropped his Stress back down below his Wisdom), he suffers a permanent reduction 1 to both his
                Intellect and Wisdom.</p>
            <h3>EPILEPTIC</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Something is not wired up just right in this character’s brain and that causes them
                to have little short outs.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When something triggers a Trauma check for the character, or their Stress
                reaches above their Int score, there is a 1 in 8 chance of the character having a seizure, in which
                they’re completely helpless for the next 1d3 minutes.</p>
            <h3>EXCOMMUNICATED</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> This character has invoked the wrath of an angry god, calling down divide judgement
                on his head. This is more commonly a member of the faithful who’s fallen away or lost his way or
                willfully defies the cult’s teaches, but less commonly, it’s an outsider who’s been declared an enemy of
                the faith. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Excommunicated members cannot gain the blessings of any miracles related to
                a single Covenant. Additionally, baleful invocations from priests of the deity that excommunicated them
                half their threshold.</p>
            <h3>FATED</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Certain character’s bear a strange sign on them that marks them for doom. The cruel
                strings of fate weave together to form a noose for them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At creation, the GM rolls 1d8!. This is the number of sessions the
                character has before Fate begins to sharpen her shears. After that point, the character takes extra
                damage each time they're hit equal to how many sessions have passed since then.</p>
            <h3>FERAL</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The wild and untamed lands are home to frontier men and families. Occasionally,
                children escape and are raised only by the wild, occasionally wolves.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Feral characters still receive any free skills from their class but any
                additional skills they try to pick up can only be from the Survival Skill Suite.</p>
            <h3>HALF LIFE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has died and forced back to life, maybe against his will.
                This character is affected by the Force Bind Spirit spell, though the Duration is set to 1d4! - 2
                (minimum 1) years and a day. Why he came back is up to you. Perhaps he had some unfinished business or
                perhaps he was targeted accidently. In any case, now he lives a half life.</p>
            <h3>HAUNTED</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Mostly commonly, this character has done something to dishonor his clan and has been
                since been haunted by one of their ancestors, displeased by their actions.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The spirit takes the corporeal form of a rotting corpse wearing it’s death mask,
                bothering the possessed at all hours to restore his family’s honor and stop being such a failure. The
                ancestor will do nothing to protect their descendant and often make life harder for them when they can.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Unfortunately, decades, if not centuries, in the grave have made the ancestor more
                than a bit senile. Even if the character is to obtain Great Honor, the ancestor doesn’t care; what it
                really wants is for the character to sacrifice themselves in a heroic way or perform suicide.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> This character doesn’t heal Stress naturally and loses 1 Honor at the end of every
                session.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Flaw may be paid off for half cost if the character has lasted 2
                sessions in Great Honor, however it goes back up to full price if they slip out of Great Honor later.
            </p>
            <h3>HEMOPHILIC</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These guys love to bleed. Well, they may not love it but they certainly do
                it a lot more than the rest of us. They take an additional d4 points of damage every time they're
                wounded. </p>
            <h3>IDIOT SAVANT</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character was born gifted. Or in other words, they were born with the
                ability to understand something but nothing else. This character picks an Advanced Skill or Mastery; all
                other Skills and Masteries cost double. The chosen Skill or Mastery now costs half.</p>
            <h3>IMPISH</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character loves getting into trouble, mostly through pranks of all
                kinds. While she’s not inherently malicious, her pranks tend to be unwelcome.</p>
            <h3>IMPOTENT</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If this character was a tree, he’d have particularly softwood, if you know
                what I mean. His lack of confidence in his abilities in the bedroom, tend to affect the other parts of
                his life, often snowballing; he loses an additional Honor for every 10 lost.</p>
            <h3>INBRED</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Often a curse of the nobility that get too close to their cousins,
                inbreeding can stunt the mental capacity of their offspring. Typically, this is pretty mild for the most
                part, but it means that increasing this character’s Intellect score costs double and they half any
                points they add to it when they level up.</p>
            <h3>LIMP</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Something isn’t working just right, whether from a birth defect or a war
                wound, causing this character to hobble along at a slower pace. Characters with a limp move at half
                their speed at all times.</p>
            <h3>MISSING ARM</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Most likely this is the result of some terrible accident or horrific war wound,
                though some people are born with an arm missing.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> A character with this Flaw is unable to wield two handed weapons, employ bows or
                crossbows, or anything else that needs two hands.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Flaw may be rolled multiple times, with the second time you take this
                flaw making it worth 60 CrP, as it prevents the character from using any weapons, and makes them unable
                to cast spells with Somatic components</p>
            <h3>MISSING EAR</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> While it won’t limit your ability to hear entirely, the shape of the ear does make
                it easier to hear things.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The first time you roll this Flaw, all Listening Checks take a penalty of -3.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The second time, all Listening checks are 3 Difficulties harder and your
                initiative dice becomes one worse. You gain 25 CrPs instead of 20 (in addition to the CrPs from the
                first time you picked this Flaw up). </p>
            <h3>MISSING EYE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> You can imagine that a character with one eye gone would have an issue with his
                depth perception. You’d be correct.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The first time a character gains this Flaw, he automatically attacks second when
                engaging in melee, even if his weapon has the greater reach and everything is counted as two range
                categories further for ranged weaponry.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The second time this Flaw is rolled, the penalties are replaced by those of
                the Blind, Total Flaw and he gains an additional 25 CrP.</p>
            <h3>MONOTHEIST</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> For this character, there is only one true god and all other divines are false
                deities or the work of devils.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> He will refuse help from pagan clerics and is bound to only miracles within
                his chosen Covenant. </p>
            <h3>MULE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While they may not show it, this character is the result of mixed ancestry
                and something about their unnatural genesis makes them sterile, unable to promulgate. While this will
                definitely make creating a dynasty an issue, certain carousers may hardly consider this a Flaw.</p>
            <h3>NO DEPTH PERCEPTION</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has a hard time reading distances making it so that he
                automatically attacks second when engaging in melee combat, even if his weapon has the greater reach and
                everything is counted as two range categories further for ranged weaponry.</p>
            <h3>OPUSPHOBIA</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Opusphobia is defined by a fear or repulsion of a certain career choice.
                Someone with this Flaw may dislike horse merchants because he sees them all at crooks or innkeepers
                because he’s afraid they’re working with the Thieves Guilds.</p>
            <h3>PASSIONLESS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Whether because of imbalance in their brain or they haven’t really found
                that thing that calls to them, a Passionless character has problems really being interested in any given
                subject they try to engage in. Passions for them cost double to purchase and increase and any situation
                die they gain from their Skills are always one smaller.</p>
            <h3>POOR</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some characters don’t have the financial leg up that others have. These
                characters must choose the following Equipment Kit during Step 11 of Character Creation. </p>

            <h3>REFUGEE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Fleeing from their homeland for either economic, religious, or conflict
                reasons, this character finds themselves in a foreign land. Their flight has forced them to leave much
                of their belongings behind, halving their starting cash and they tend to be unfamiliar with the language
                and customs. Their native language is not the main one for this area and the Language and Law of the
                country they’re fleeing to costs double as they had to learn it under stressful circumstances</p>
            <h3>SECRET IDENTITY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> For whatever reason, whether they’re hiding from enemies or they want to
                put their old life behind them, this character is trying to keep their past a secret. When this flaw is
                rolls, this character selects one of their Archetypes to be the remnant of their past. Any mention of
                the Archetypes abilities nets this character 1 Stress.</p>
            <h3>SELF MARTYR</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Life doesn’t feel complete if people don’t know how much you’re sacrificing
                for them.</p>
            <h3>SENSITIVE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has superb senses compared to others, however it makes it
                challenging for them to function sometimes as they can just get overloaded.</p>
            <h3>SENSITIVE HEARING</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character is incredibly prone to noise. Other’s normal talking voice
                sound to them like they’re yelling. You’ll think this would help them suss out noise more effectively
                but instead it makes it harder to hear because there’s too much sensory input.</p>
            <h3>TALKER</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Whether around the campfire or in stressful situation, this person can’t
                keep their mouth shut. They’ll just talk and talk, only stopping to take necessary breathes.</p>
            <h3>THRALL</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thralls are those taken in raids or the children of slaves. Technically,
                they’re ‘free’ but they have a social stigma that follow them. Thralls gain no extra starting cash and
                half the amount of equipment the kit normally starts with and as never gain Advantage with a tie in a
                Social Conflict. </p>
            <h3>VOW of POVERTY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Middle Realm corrupts and those that wish to come closer to the Gods’
                Realm sometimes eschew worldly possessions. This character only keeps enough wealth on them to buy basic
                food to sustain them for that day, all other wealth is donated to any local cults. They give their goods
                to the needy, not fellow adventurers. Their Max Favor is increased by 1. </p>
            <h5>Character Vitals</h5>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The purpose of this chapter is to condense all the rules for calculating
                things about your character so that it can keep the other chapters to just rules you’ll need at the spur
                of the moment during gameplay. To this end, these rules are missing why they’re important and what
                you’ll actually use them for but they do reference the chapter where more is to be found. </p>
            <h1>STRESS</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Working under pressure can get to you. When your crew mates are relying on you to
                pull out a win, it can mess with your head. Your character can become stressed under these circumstances
                and stress can later manifest in odd behaviors.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Characters can gain Stress in two ways in a lot of ways and those are
                discussed in their various sections - taking damage, making Skill Checks, etc. - the only one we’ll go
                over here is Stress can be gained (and healed) from acting out your character’s social Characteristics,
                especially when not playing them would be a huge benefit.</p>
            <h3>STRESS PENALTIES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Stress affects almost everything you do, making your life harder and your
                character becomes emotionally pent up.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Every 10 points of Stress gives you a penalty of 1 to Defense, Skill Check
                difficulties, Running and Sprinting time.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Stress affects Morale, lowering the character's Morale Threshold Category
                by 1 per non-Wound inflicted 10 Stress.</p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Honor Through Accountability </h2>
                    </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"> In the heat of the moment, it’s hard to keep track of all the bonuses
                            and penalties that apply to situations, especially the penalties and especially Stress
                            penalties, which change during the fight.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"> Because of this, it isn’t required that you apply Stress penalties.
                            However, if you do, you gain 1 Honor and the other side also applies their Stress penalty
                            without that extra Honor.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"> If the GM reminds you that you need to apply your Stress, you don’t get
                            anything but the penalty.</p>

            <h3>HEALING STRESS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Stress heals slowly over time but there are things you can do to speed it up. You
                have to actively go out and do things that relax your character. There are several things you can do.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The first is to give into his nature. By role playing his Flaws in a
                detrimental way, a character can relieve 1 or more Stress (GM’s option). This means that when a
                character sees a situtation where his Stress could give him a disadvantage, he can bring it up the GM.
                If approved, the character heals Stress. The GM may also suggest this option as well if she things the
                situation warrents it.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The second way is through hobbies. Hobbies are based off your character's Social
                Characteristics, but besides that, they can be anything, from whoring it up to spending time with the
                family or working in their shop. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You gain 1 point of Relaxation for each hour spent on a hobby, though you
                can only spend up to the number of dice that Characteristic has in hours per day. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Finally, you can indulge in creature comforts. This can be done by by
                buying a nice bedroll or even hiring someone to set up your camp for you so you can relax at the end of
                the day. The rule of thumb is that each applicable Trait the equipment has gives you an additional point
                of Relaxation when applicable. So, an extra soft, double padded, and tailored bedroll will always do you
                good but a waterproof tent will really only give you a bonus in inclement weather. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> When your Relaxation matches your current Stress, you heal 1 Stress and your
                Relaxation drops to 0 again. Yes, that means that the more Stressed you become, the harder it is to
                decompress yourself. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Also, as an aside here; the Musician and Cooking/Baking Advanced Skills
                also help heal Stress, so you can look into those.</p>
            <h3>MENTAL BREAKDOWNS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> When your Total Stress equals your ( Int + Wis ) * 2, called your Stress Threshold,
                you've gotten to the point that you just can't take it anymore. This results in a Mental Breakdown for
                your character. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When this happens they do eveything in their power to separate themselves
                from the stressor as quickly as possible. If they're in a scenario that directly threatens their life
                (like combat or dangling from a cliff), they'll separate themselves as quickly as possible but will pay
                little attention to their companion's safety. At this point, they're so overwhelmed, they don't really
                care. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Until that Stress is all healed, any further Stress will not only give the usual
                penalties, but also deals 1 damage per point inflicted. This damage is all on one wound and is unhealed
                while the character is having a Mental Breakdown. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Should the character start to bleed out, they suffer a heartattack and die.
            </p>
            <h1>VITALITY</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Vitality represents how close you are to passing out and dying. It is both your
                health and fatigue. As you take damage, you will get closer to death and gain more penalties.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Vitality is divided into 5 categories, representing what percentage of
                damage a character has taken: </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>FRESH: 0%</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>TIRED: >1%</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>HURT: >25%</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>BLOODIED: >50%</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>WOUNDED: >75%</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>BLEEDING OUT: >100%</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> To calculate how much Vitality you have for each category, add a roll of your
                Primary Archetype’s Vitality Die to your Constitution + their Vitality Size Modifier. That’s your total.
                Divide that by 4. If you have a remainder, alternate between rounding down on every category except the
                Wounded category.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> So, if you’re a Human with and your Vitality Die is a d10 and you roll a 7 with a
                Constitution of 12, you have 29 Vitality. You’re Tired at 28, Hurt at 22, Bloodied at 15, and Wounded 8.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Record your Vitality Die roll on your character sheet. </p>
            <h3>DROPPING A VITALITY CATEGORY & ENCUMBRANCE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> As stated, the more damage you take, the harder the fight becomes. When you drop a
                Vitality Category, you gain an amount of Stress equal to your Encumbrance.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your Encumbrance is equal to your Con Encumb. + Wis Encumb. + Encumb. from
                armor and shields + however many times you’re over your carry limit.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CHANGING ENCUMBRANCE WHILE WOUNDED</strong> The Stress
                you gain from wounds isn't healed by normal means; it's only healed when either your Encumbrance is
                lowered or when your wounds heal enough to move you up a category.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> That means, if you took 10 Stress dropping from a Vitality Category, taking
                a spa day wouldn't help. Instead, you should see a surgeon or a doctor. Now, what you could do is not
                carry so much gear around. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> So, for example, let's say that you have a base Encumbrance of 10 from your
                Abilities but you're carrying around only a Light Shield, so your actual Encumbrance is 16. You drop
                from Fresh to Hurt, and you gain 32 Stress because of it. You're in the middle of combat, so you can't
                Take a Breather, so you drop your shield, your Encumbrance drops to 10 and you heal 12 Stress, which
                isn't bad. After the battle, you take a moment to catch your breathe and so you're now only Tired. Since
                your Encumbrance is now 10 so you heal 10 Stress. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Now, the flip side of this is that if you become MORE Encumbered while
                wounded, you gain that amount of Stress instantly. So, continuing the above example, if you were to then
                pick up your Light Shield again, your Encumbrance would raise by 6 and you'd gain 6 Stress. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PASSING OUT</strong> All characters pass out when they
                start Bleeding Out, but it is possible that they'll pass out before then. If your remaining Vitality is
                greater than or equal to your Stress Penalty, your character collapses, helpless but not actively
                bleeding out. In a sense, he's forced to Take a Breather. or remain helpless.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if you've got 30 Stress and 29 Vitality, when you've taken 25 damage,
                you're character collapses, forced to Take a Breather.</p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Wound Category Exception</h2>
                    </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Just as an aside - going from Fresh to Tired doesn’t count as
                            changing a Wound Category for purposes of triggering a Trauma check.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h3>TAKING A BREATHER</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Pausing and not doing anything but move at a Stroll while not Threatened for 20
                Seconds - Con, minimum 3 Seconds, heals you half the damage (rounded down) that you've take since the
                last time you've Taken a Breather. Damage healed this way is taken from the smallest non-long term
                fatigue wound. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> If you become Threatened while taking a breather but continue to try and catch your
                breath, you take 1 Stress for every second you remain so.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’re attacked and still definitely rest, you reduce your defense dice
                by 1 size. If they miss, you’re breather is unaffected, though in either case, the attacker loses an
                Honor.</p>
            <h3>HEALING</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Combat is dangerous. Even if you survive, you could end up with wounds that you
                carry with you for months on end.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Each time damage is done, it is tracked in a new wound.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Wounds heals at a slow rate. Each point takes a number of days equal to the damage
                done to heal it 1 point.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> So, a 5 point wound takes 5 days to become a 4 point wound, which takes 4 days to
                becomes a 3 point wound, and so on. That means it takes 15 days to completely heal ( 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1).
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thankfully, each wound heals simultaneously. So, if you have 3 separate 4
                point wounds, you’ll be completely healed by day 10.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RECUPERATION (HEALING WITH RELAXATION)</strong>
                Another option you can do to speed up long term healing is to rest and indulge yourself. If the only
                Stress your character has is from Wounds, any points of Relaxation gained that day are taken off the
                days to heal off your Wounds. This is somewhat limited however since you can only drop a single Wound's
                days to heal by the amount it had left on that Severity. So, if I have a 10 Severity Wound, with 8 days
                of healing left, gaining 11 points of Relaxation, would only reduce it to a 9 Severity Wound with 9 days
                left to heal that day. However, if I also had another Wound, I could use that otherwise wasted
                Relaxation on it.</p>
            <h1>HONOR</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Honor is a measure how not only how a person measures their own integrity but also
                how other people see them. Honor isn’t about doing the common sense thing; it’s about doing the heroic
                thing. People who run from a fight, even when outnumbered, lose Honor. People who let others talk bad
                about them and don’t get even lose Honor.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The question of Honor isn’t a question of good and evil; many evil men have
                been honorable. It’s more about living up to the ideals of your culture and being true to your inner
                self.</p>

            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> If this is your first Bonfire character in a campaign, you receive a bonus 25 CrPs.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’re here because you’ve had a character die, this bonus CrP is based
                on the Honor category your character was in when they died.</p>
            <h3>STARTING HONOR</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Honor category in which you start is determined by your “Start Honor”,
                listed under your Charisma. You start at the bottom of the corresponding category.</p>
            <h3>HONOR CATEGORIES & BONUSES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Honor has its benefits. Confidence allows you to push yourself a little bit more than
                you otherwise would. During the game, you can spend your Honor points to influence anything, rolls or
                static metrics, whenever you want on a 1 to 1 basis. Doing so lowers your Honor but might save your
                character’s life. So, if you roll a 13 and your opponent rolls a 14, you could spend 3 Honor to beat
                their total. Likewise, if an enemy deals 8 damage to you and you have 6 Honor, you could spend all of it
                and only take 2 damage.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Additionally, each category has an Honor Dice, which can be rolled to add or subtract
                like Honor.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Honor cannot go above 25 or below 0. The size of the Honor Die is also
                determined at the beginning of session and doesn’t change during play even if the category does.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DISHONOR (0 - 5 Honor, No Honor Die)</strong> The lowest
                category, this person is unsure that they have what it takes to be a hero and so every decision is laced
                with hesitation and uncertainty.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LOW HONOR (6 - 10 Honor, d4!)</strong> This character
                hasn’t really proved anything, one way or another. Others and herself are waiting for her to make her
                mark on the world.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AVERAGE HONOR (11 - 15 Honor, d6!)</strong> Having
                reached this category, the character has shown that they have potential and some follow through.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HIGH HONOR (16 - 20 Honor, d8!)</strong> She has now
                separated herself from the common rabble and can stand a head above the crowd.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GREAT HONOR (20 - 25 Honor, d10!)</strong> This
                rare sliver represents those who can perfectly balance being ahead of others but not so much so that
                they invoke the ire of those below them as well as being confident while not being cocky.</p>
            <h3>END OF SESSION HONOR AWARDS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> At the end of each session, the players will elect each other’s characters for
                things they think that character deserved Honor for. It is generally poor form to elect yourself but is
                also reasonable if you pulled off someonething amazing and the rest of the group didn't seem to notice.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These elections need to fit into one of these three categories:</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STRENGTH</strong> This character demonstrated strength
                based on how their character’s culture defines strength, which could be physical prowess but could also
                be cunning or grifting.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MASTERY</strong> This is given when a character solves a
                tricky problem or came up with a creative solution. Note, this shouldn't be given for good rolls unless
                the players want to lose Honor for bad rolls; this is about out of the box thinking.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COURAGE</strong> When the chips were down, did your
                character give up the fight or did they really show what it means to be a hero and stare down death?</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ROLEPLAYING</strong> Did the player really role
                play his character? Where his decisions about what he thought gave him the best chance to win or was it
                about what his character thought would be a good idea? Note, that since players are electing each other,
                jackasses who use “that’s just what my character would do” to dick over the party won’t get rewarded for
                this much. This should be specifically linked to a character's Social Characteristics.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GAINING HONOR DICE</strong> Whenever you go up an Honor
                Category, you gain a free use of your Honor Dice. Also, when you reach 25 Honor, you get one as well,
                even though you didn't technically go up a category. Once used, they go away but they stay with your
                character as long as they live. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Certain Archetype abilities may also give you them temporarily, in which
                case, the Archetype will note for how long you have them. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">For each of these categories, the GM can also dock Honor from a character. Did they
                run away or did they conveniently forget any Characteristics that would have screwed them over?</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">That and spending Honor are the two main ways of losing Honor.</p>
            <h1>FAME</h1>
            <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A good majority of people want to be associated with heroes and legends,
                even the bad ones. Charles Manson gets love letters everyday, after all. Famous people soon find
                themselves surrounded by people willing to help for their 15 minutes. Some of these people may actually
                end up being useful in the long term. So, it’s important to track you Fame or try to increase it, if you
                can.</p>
            <h3>GAINING & LOSING FAME</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> You gain Fame by doing things. This is primarily from completing Goals and
                Benchmarks but it can be from completing quests and simply bragging about your exploits in the local
                tavern.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The reason that Goals gain you more Fame than if you were just running
                around doing random fetch quests is because completing Goals creates a story that people want to talk
                about. Sure, they can talk about you slaying that dragon, but if it’s also the dragon that kidnapped
                your sister, that’s much more compelling and worth gossiping about at the local watering hole.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You lose Fame by not doing things. Every month your character doesn’t do
                anything new, people talk about her less and less. They lose 1 point of Fame for every month they don’t
                complete at least 1 Benchmark. </p>
            <h3>FAME & HONOR</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Honor and Fame have a close tie as the more people talk about you, the more your
                reputation, whether good or ill, gets around.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At the end of each session, for every 10 points of Fame a character has,
                they gain an additional Honor point, but this is only added at the end of the session if they don’t end
                with a negative Honor pool. So, a character with 70 Fame that ends with -3 Honor, drops an Honor
                Category at the end of the session. </p>
            <h3>ATTRACTING NPCS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">While a character may use the Recruiting skill to find hirelings at anytime, after a
                character reaches 50 Fame, they start having people seek them out. At that point, and at every 10 (or 25
                for those with a Caster Archetype) Fame above that, the GM rolls on the Follower Attraction table.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These come in three varieties:</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CAMP FOLLOWERS </strong>These are those that wish to
                swim in the wake of the big fish, often profiting off the other followers of the party and are often
                washerwoman, prostitutes, or errand boys. They don’t ask anything of the party but are happy to be hired
                on for specialty jobs.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">They’re also the least loyal, abandoning the party should the party start to
                lose Retainers and they’ll never put their lives on the line for the party.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RETAINERS </strong>Retainers make up the paid help. They
                often seek out the party directly and have a basic skill. The idea is that the party will help them
                further their craft and connections for a bit of pay. They’ll make themselves as helpful as possible -
                such as repairing armor and weapons for the cost of room and board.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Retainers won’t break contract unless the captain of the party falls into
                Low Honor and will be more loyal than camp followers, however, they’ll only risk their lives if it’s in
                their contract to do so.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SIDEKICKS </strong>Sidekicks are something special. A
                Sidekick is a person who is completely loyal to a character. They would lay down their lives for a
                character. A character has a limited number of Sidekicks that he can call upon over the course of his
                whole life time.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Sidekicks are childhood friends, people who deify the character, or other such
                unquestionably loyal followers. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">A Sidekicks is essentially a second Player Character that the player gets to run.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Any new follower can be declared by the player to be a Sidekick, having sought out
                the party, he is recognized as an old friend or a new friend who swears undying loyalty to the
                character. Additionally, a follower can be elevated to the status of a Sidekick if he or the character
                saves the other’s life.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Even before 50 Fame, a character can search out his Sidekicks, however, they must be
                old friends from his past, in this case.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Sidekicks start with an automatic d6 Devotion to the character and the character
                gains an equivalent Devotion in return.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Only severe abuse can break the bond between the hero and his Sidekick but
                should this happen, the Sidekick becomes an enemy of equivalent zeal.</p>
            <h5>Masteries</h5>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Mastery Limitations</h2>
                    </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"> Masteries are sometimes natural gifts that either have been around since
                            the character’s childhood or emerge during their adventuring career, or they’re specific
                            area that your character has trained to develop.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> In any case, unless stated otherwise, you may only take a
                            Mastery once.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h1>GENERAL MASTERIES</h1>
            <h3>A NOTCH ABOVE the REST</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 30</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Even in a crowd of kings, this person would stick out. They often carry
                themselves with the perfect blend of confidence and humility. Those with this Mastery max out their
                Honor at 30, instead of 25, however, they gain the additional Honor Dice once they reach 25 and then
                again at 30, though going above 25 doesn’t increase the size (in case you were wondering).</p>
            <h3>AMBIDEXTROUS</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 30</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">With this mastery, a character is just as proficient with one hand as with
                the other, which may become helpful if they end up suffering an amputation. Mostly it means that they
                can better fight with a weapon in each hand. Rules for this are found in <strong>Chapter 10:
                    Combat</strong>.</p>
            <h3>ANTI-MAGICAL BLANK</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 30</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There’s just something about this character that refuses to give when
                spells are slung around her. She increases the Drain of any spell that affects her by 3. Caster
                Archetypes are barred from taking this Mastery.</p>
            <h3>ANTIQUARIAN</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You may invoke a minor Relic’s power once per session for free and are
                considered 1 Honor Category higher for medium Relics.</p>
            <h3>ARCANE GRIP</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> By sheer force of will and a natural connection to the Painted World, a
                character only loses 1 SP per 12 seconds while not channeling.</p>
            <h3>ARCANE TRAINING</h3>
            <h3> CrP: *</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Mages, Speakers, and Wizards may increase their magical might through study
                and understanding in a way that other Caster Archetypes cannot. This is represented by Arcane Training
                which these Caster Archetypes can purchase.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> When you purchase an Arcane Training, you select one of the Weird Traditions. The
                price is 8 + 2 * (Current Ranks + number of previous Traditions trained in). Each purchase increases the
                Rank you have in that Tradition. Going back and purchasing more Ranks in a Tradition you’re already
                Trained in doesn’t “shift” it around for purposes of “number of previous Traditions trained in”.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, if you’re a Mage, and you train to become Rank 1 in Occultism, which
                costs you 8 CrP ( 8 + 2 * ( 0 + 0 ) ), and then train to become Rank 1 in Calling, which costs you 10
                CrP ( 8 + 2 * ( 0 + 1 ) ), going back and becoming Rank 2 in Occultism would only cost you 12 ( 8 + 2 *
                ( 2 + 0 ) ).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When casting a spell of that Tradition, you gain a bonus of SP equal to
                your Rank in that Tradition. </p>
            <h3>BELOVED</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 20</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some are just favored by the Divines, the teacher's pets of the celestial
                world. Increase your Max Favor by 1.</p>
            <h3>CHARLATAN</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 40</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sometimes people have a gift for certain things and it allows to reach
                beyond their own training and adapt other styles into their own. This Mastery allows a character to
                choose a class ability from another Archetype and incorporate it into their class, however, this ability
                starts at first level and stays there, only “leveling up” if they invest 20 CrP into at their level up.
            </p>
            <h3>CONCERT CASTER</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This character serves as an effective conduit to help others channel the
                Painted World and is considered an additional person when lowering the channelling time while Concert
                Casting.</p>
            <h3>EARDSTAPA</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 10</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Created by the rangers of Yr Alban, this is an ad hoc language of marks and symbols
                sometimes called “Wander Signs”, used to communicate things to other people who might go the same way.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Often carved into trees or marked on stones, they provide useful
                information about the area in very simple, broad terms. Below are the most common signs:</p>
            <h1> src="../../../assets/images/signs.png" alt="wander signs"</h1>
            <h3>ELDRITCH ADEPT</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 10</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While they don’t exactly revel in it, a person can adjust to the sickening
                waves that result from spells. With this Mastery, this character gains 1 less Stress from weirdburn
                around them. Casters may also pick up this Mastery as well.</p>
            <h3>EXTRA SPECIAL MIX</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Playing with guns and gunpowder is dangerous, but a little tinker may help
                you learn how to refine your powders so that your barker is way worse than your bite. With this Mastery,
                use the larger of the two damage dice to determine Flinch. For firelance, always use the highest rolled
                of the two damage dice.</p>
            <h3>LINKED SOUL</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This character has an exceptionally special link with the lead caster while
                concert casting where they feel like one soul instead of two touching. Their channelling dice isn’t
                reduced one size if they’re directly touching the lead caster.</p>
            <h3>HEIRLOOM</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 35</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This character has received a special gift from their family or their
                community: a Minor Relic. This Minor Relic needs to either be noted in the character's backstory as
                recieving one of these is a pretty big deal. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Servant characters receive a discount of 15 CrP and those with at least one
                Archetype with Inheritance receive a 10 CrP discount for this Mastery. Servant and Inheritance does
                stack with each other but two Inheritances don't. It can be picked up after Character Creation but only
                at double the price and there needs to be reason (such as a family member dying). </p>
            <h3>HEROIC/VILLAIN SPIRIT</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 20</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When the chips are down, this character comes in swinging. Once per session,
                a character can increase their Honor Die by 1 size.</p>
            <h3>TEACHER</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 20</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A great teacher can be worth their weight in gold: Any time an ally levels
                up, you and your companion may choose to train an extra day, if you do your ally may take a 5 CrP
                discount on any one Skill or Mastery you currently have. You must have a higher degree of mastery than
                your ally in order for them to receive the discount. </p>
            <h3>THAUMATURGE</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 20</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character finds that certain Miracles are just easier to invoke than
                others. When you purchase this Mastery, select a specific Miracle. Increase your Honor Dice one size
                when invoking that specific Miracle. It still needs to follow the normal restrictions (so be sure to
                check with the GM to make sure the Miracle falls within your Covenant).</p>
            <h1>COMBAT MASTERIES</h1>
            <h3>ACUTE ALERTNESS</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This a character can sometimes start acting before they even consciously
                know that something is wrong, either through a natural survival instinct or years of training. This
                Mastery lowers the Initiative Die of the character by 1 size.</p>
            <h3>ARMOR BASIC TRAINING</h3>
            <h3> CrP: *</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This basic training allows a character to more effectively utilize armor of
                different types based on their level of familiarity with them. It’s split into 3 categories:</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LIGHT (15 CrP)</strong> This covers armor that tends to
                not to restrict the wearer so is often favored by skill centric characters.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MEDIUM (10 CrP)</strong> This armor is a bit heavier
                than Light armor and offers a tradeoff between protection and mobility.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HEAVY (10 CrP)</strong> The armor in this
                category is durable, thick, and heavy, able to withstand blows but at the cost of being hard to move in.

            <p style="margin:0px;"> You have to buy armor training in sequence, starting at Light and moving all the way
                to Heavy.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can always try and use armor without the baseline knowledge of how to
                properly wear and don it, but the Defense penalty and Encumbrance are both doubled if that’s the case.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can further your training in armor to increase the benefits. See the
                Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training Sidebar for more details.</p>

                        <p style="margin:0px;"> Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training are further training in those
                            particular fields. They can only be taken for things that you already have Basic Training
                            in. So, a character can’t take any masteries for any Medium Armor if he doesn’t have the
                            Medium Armor Basic Training. </p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Every type will have categories you can specialize in. Each
                            specialization in that area gives them a +1 for every Rank they obtain in it. This can't
                            bring a negative bonus above 0 </p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"> The price for increasing your Rank in a category is the Tier’s Base Cost
                            + twice the current Rank.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can’t buy up a Rank again until you’ve either filled out
                            all the rest of the category or you have two categories at that Rank. This is true all the
                            way down so your Advanced Training for a weird looking triangle (as shown below). This is
                            true even if you have reached the maximum benefit from a category.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"> For example, let’s say that you want to increase your training in Scale
                            Armor specifically, which have the stats of Def 0, Init 3, Recovery 1, and Encumbrance of 8.
                            If you want to get a Rank 5 in Encumbrance (lowering it by 4 points), you would have to also
                            buy a Rank 4 in one category, Rank 3 in another, and Rank 2 in a final thing. </p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Ideally, that means that you bought Rank 4 in Init, Rank 3 in
                            Recovery, and Rank 2 in Def. Notice that that additional 2 Ranks in Recovery and that Rank 1
                            in Def doesn’t give you anything besides allowing you to reach Rank 4 in Encumbrance. </p>

                            that your shield can take 19 points of damage before saving vs d20!+10, 24 before saving vs

                            firing a ranged weapon: here’s a breakdown for you.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if you already loading and cranked (drawing) your crossbow,
                            it would only take 5 seconds to fire it.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MISSILE RETRIEVAL </strong>This is drawing
                            the missile from its quiver or pouch. For firearms, that means drawing out the powder and
                            bullets.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FUSE </strong>This is the process of
                            lighting the fuse. This can be dropped to 1 second but increases the chance of backfiring
                            from 1 to 5.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LOADING </strong>This is knocking the arrow
                            or loading the bullet and powder in the barrel.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAW </strong>This is drawing back the bow,
                            cranking the crossbow, or cocking your arm for the throw. This can be prepped ahead of time
                            for the belly- and crossbows but not the composite, long, or war bows</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>AIMING </strong>This is actually sighting
                            your target and lining up the shot. This can be skipped, making it so you fire faster, but
                            you roll attack on a d12! instead of the standard d20!. This can't bring a weapon below it's
                            minimum weapon Recovery.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FIRING </strong>This is pulling the
                            trigger or loosing the arrow. </p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Masteries that lower Recovery take from Missile Retrieval, Fuse,
                            Loading, Drawing, and Aiming evenly but they can never reduce a single category to below 1
                            second. So, the minimum firing Recovery for a Composite Bow is 5 seconds. </p>

            <h3>ATTACK on the RUN</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Those with this Mastery have a special gift when it comes to aiming and
                moving. Instead of gaining a lowering their Attack Dice 2 per Movement Category when using ranged
                weapons, they lower it by 1 per Movement Category.</p>
            <h3>BLIND FIGHTING</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 30</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> By relying on other senses, a character can somewhat make up for the loss
                of their sight. They increase their attack and defense die by 1 size when in dim or dark lightning
                conditions. </p>
            <h3>BORN GUNNER</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 5</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> For some people, there is nothing sweeter than the smell of blackpowder and the
                horribly loud bang? A symphony. This Mastery lowers the delay suffered by the person from firearms going
                off by 1 second. This can be purchased multiple times but the cost doubles each time (5, 10, 20, etc.).
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Being around firearms tends to make you less susceptible to the pure terror
                of firearms and so the cost of this master is discounted by 5 for everytime you flinch because of a
                firearm going off. </p>
            <h3>COVER CHAMPION</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Increase your Cover dice by 1 size or consider yourself 5% if you already
                have flat cover.</p>
            <h3>DASHER</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 15</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> One might describe this character as having a certain spring in their step
                and they use it to get up and going quicker than those around them. A person with this Mastery can
                increase their speed category by 2, allowing them to move from a Walk to a Run in a single second, for
                example.</p>
            <h3>DEADEYE</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can see the whites of your enemy’s eyes, you can also get a good sense
                of where their vital organs are. When at -4 range or lower, add a d4! to your damage.</p>
            <h3>DEADLY FLANKER</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 30</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You’ve trained yourself to seize openings when they flash by, jumping on
                every lapse in your opponent’s judgement. When flanking from the side, you lower your target’s defense
                die by 1, including the dice of those using shields (though they still get a chance to Parry). This
                doesn’t, however, give you any benefit for attacking from directly behind.</p>
            <h3>DECEITFUL MEASURE</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 20</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Carefully positioning and moving offline can give you the edge to strike
                first or keep your opponent at bay. This Mastery increases the Measure of any weapon you wield by a 1/2
                foot for determining who hits first but not for whether a person can Engage or get In Your Guard.</p>
            <h3>MARATHONER</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 15</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Through training and breathing techniques, this character can fight and
                sprint longer than others. They receive a -1 to their Encumbrance.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can buy this Mastery multiple times, but the price increases by 2 each
                time. So, the second time, you gain a -2 for 17 CrP, the third -3 for 19, and so on.</p>
            <h3>OPPORTUNISTIC FIGHTER (ATTACK)</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 30</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">By watching for openings and waiting to strike, a character can take
                advantage of any opening. This doubles the range for Near Perfect Attacks.</p>
            <h3>OPPORTUNISTIC FIGHTER (CQC)</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 30</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">By watching for openings and waiting to strike, a character can take
                advantage of any opening and slip instead their guard. On a Near Perfect Attack or Defense, this
                character can close in or retreat one range position.</p>
            <h3>OPPORTUNISTIC FIGHTER (DEFENSE)</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 30</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">By watching for openings and waiting to strike, a character can take
                advantage of any opening. This doubles the range for Near Perfect Defenses.</p>
            <h3>FLEET FOOTED</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A fleet-footed character tends to win foot races as he just goes flat out
                faster than those around him. His Running speed is increased by 2.5 feet / second and his Sprinting
                speed is increased by 5 feet / second.</p>
            <h3>HEALTHY</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 20</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Nothing can stop this juggernaut, especially not weapons. This Mastery
                gives the character a one time, but permanent +1d8 to their Vitality. This dice is affected by the Min
                Vitality of that character's Con. </p>
            <h3>IMPROVED DEFENSE</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Through muscle training or by simply having a talent for placing their
                shield in the right place at the right time, the character is able to move effectively parry blows that
                would otherwise land. Each purchase of this Mastery allows the character to increase their defense dice
                by 1 size verses one attacker up to their standard defense die. Each additional purchase doubles the
                cost of this Mastery.</p>
            <h3>IRON SIDES</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 35</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is a nickname often given to these characters. Whether through ritual
                scarification or just simply having thick skin, this character has a natural +1 DR.</p>
            <h3>QUICK HEALING</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 15</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some people just bounce back from wounds that would have put others down
                for months. With this Mastery, a character heals 1 day quicker for each level of wound severity. So, a 5
                Severity Wound would heal in 10 days ( 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0) instead of 15 ( 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1).</p>
            <h3>SHARP SHOOTER</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 35</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Careful aim can get you so far; sometimes, some people are just born with
                an eye for distance. The penalties for long ranged shots are lowered from 16 to 12, and from 32 to 24.
            </p>
            <h3>SHIELD BASIC TRAINING</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 10</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> This teaches a character the basic understanding of how to properly use and employ
                shields in combat. This training covers all types of shields.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can always try to use a shield without the training, however, you gain
                a -4 to your defense when doing so.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can further your training in shields to increase the benefits. See the
                Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training Sidebar for more details.</p>
            <h3>SHIELD BREAKER</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> With an innate understanding on resonance and timing, this character can target the
                weak spot of a shield, causing it to break more easily. This character rerolls the Shield and Weapon
                Breakage Theshold by 5 when dealing out Shield Damage.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This bonus does apply to the Strike the Weapon Combat Tactic, however,
                weapons with no Shield Damage don’t gain any benefit from this Mastery.</p>
            <h3>SURE FOOTED</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 20</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A solid stance or a dense physique, this character is harder to move. This
                Mastery increase your character’s Vitality Size Modifier for Knock-Backs by 5 and gives you a +5 to
                defense against Pushes and Throws. </p>
            <h3>UNYIELDING</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 30</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Like a warrior of old, this guy could take a spear right through the gut and
                keep fighting. For Trauma checks, this character rolls a 1d12, instead of a d20.</p>
            <h3>WEAPON BASIC TRAINING</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 10</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> By gaining the basic understanding of how a weapon is wielded, used and taken care
                of, you not only expand its longevity, but also your longevity on the battlefield.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Weapon training is taken for individual weapons, however its benefits extend to
                weapons of that share similar features.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> A person completely untrained in weapons both Attacks and Defends with that weapon
                using a d12!. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> However, one trained uses a d20! Attack and Defense (depending on whether or not
                they use a shield). </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, this is extended to any weapon that shares similar qualities as
                defined by the Weapon Tiers, up to Tier 4.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> For example, a character with training only in the Dusack extends that training to
                all melee weapons.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A character with training in both a Melee and Ranged weapons, gains that
                training to all weapons. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, why would you take training in multiple weapons once you have one melee
                and one ranged? Because this training allows you to further master that weapon, increasing its
                usefulness.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can further your training in weapons to increase the benefits. See the
                Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Training Sidebar for more details. </p>

                            by its size and balance and no matter how much you train, you can’t overcome that hurtle.

            <h3> CrP: 20</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">By compensating for wind, range, and other factors, an archer can take some
                control over a bad situation. This Mastery allows you to roll 2d4s on a ranged missed and keep whichever
                one you want.</p>

            <h3>DANGER SENSE</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 20</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> There are people who have an ability to know when things are up and guess at how
                difficult something is going to be. Even if they can’t put a finger on, they can get a sense of the
                danger (Get it? That’s the name of the Mastery).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Those with this Mastery get to know how many Obstacles are in play during a
                Skill Challenge; when they’re added and when they’re removed. This doesn’t tell them what they are, why
                type, or how difficult, but it does give them a good sense of how complex the situation is.</p>

            <h3> CrP: 10</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Those that have trained themselves to study, listen, and watch, can make
                more out of resources as their fingers than others. When using an Asset, those with this Mastery half
                the Time Investment. </p>

            <h3> CrP: 30</h3>

            <h3>KNACK</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 10</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Sometimes people have a gift for certain things. When buying this Mastery, the
                character selects a Skill Suite. They get one free reroll per session for this Skill Suite or any of its
                Advanced Skills. This can be for a Skill Check or it can be for any Leverage you brought in because of
                that Skill.</p>

                with this Mastery gain an extra d4! to one of their Skill Checks.</p>
            <h3>OLD FRIEND</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 15*</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Your character didn’t start in a vacuum and he’s got resources he can draw on when
                he needs a helping hand. When you purchase this Mastery, you gain an Asset; it can actually be a friend
                but it can also be a membership to a club, a parent with a library, or whatever else you can think of.
                The Time Investment starts at 2 Hours and their Rank in a Skill of your choosing starts at 5.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Players subtract their Charisma from the price and don’t have to redeem it right
                away, however, once redeemed (and defined), however, it can’t be changed.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Mastery can be bought multiple times, each time gaining a new Asset
                they can use, but each purchase adds 5 to the price.</p>
            <h3>ON YOUR TOES</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 20</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you think quickly and stay on your toes, you can get away with what
                others can’t. One you purchase this Mastery, choose an Advanced Skill. Once per session, when using that
                Skill in connection with one of the Strategies, you forgo rolling or gaining a Stress Die.</p>
            <h3>POLYGLOT</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 15</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This character has the gift of gab and can pick up on other languages
                quicker than most, learning the nuances of phrases and meanings. Any language that the polyglot gains
                Rank 4 or above in is considered a native tongue for her.</p>
            <h3>PRODIGY</h3>
            <h3> CrP: *</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Some characters have just a flair or talent for a certain skill set that makes
                learning the subject a breeze. Characters with this Mastery get a discount of 3 CrP for 1 Advanced
                Skill, chosen at the time they purchase this Mastery. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Skill you choose also determines the price. Take the unmodified cost of
                that Skill and multiply it by 2. You can take this Mastery multiple times but each time increases the
                price by the unmodified cost of the Skill, however, you can't pick the same Skill twice. </p>
            <h3>REAL HELPER</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 15</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When times get tough, sometimes the tough get helping. Those with this
                Mastery give others an additional +3 when someone else uses Preparation that they made. This is in
                addition to the other benefits of Preparation.</p>
            <h3>SHORT SLEEPER</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 35</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some weirdos don’t need to sleep as much as the rest of us. What they do
                with that time will forever remain a mystery but we can assume it’s nothing good. That’s people with
                this Mastery, who half the each threshold when it comes to Long Term Exhaustion from sleep.</p>
            <h3>SURVIVAL TRAINING</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 20</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> While others suffer from lack of sleep or water, this character keeps going. When
                you buy this Mastery you must select Food, or Water. For Long Term Exhaustion, you half each threshold,
                allowing you to survive (and indulge) yourself on less.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> So, if you selected Food, you can Indulge on 2.5 lbs of food, go on Maintenance on
                1.5 lbs, and suffer from Deprivation under .5 lb.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can buy this Mastery twice, the first for the base price, the second
                time for 35 CrP. The second time you purchase it, you get the other option so you can’t pick the same
                thing the second time, sorry.</p>
            <h3>TEAMWORK TRAINING</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 15</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">While helping another person in a Skill Challenge by using the Helper Skill,
                only one of you takes the Stress Die.</p>
            <h3>THIEVES CANT</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 35</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Much like Eardstapa, Thieves Cant is an ad hoc language used for members of the many
                trades, but instead of marks, they use clothing and turns of phrase to communicate their intentions to
                others. Thieves Cant gives the ability to say things without saying them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Thieves Cant is based on call and response, with confirmation and steps.
                The examples below are taken from the I Duchi Selvaggi version of the Cant, which is the most common and
                from which other Cants draw their lineage from.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LAY OF THE LAND</strong> This is before contact
                is made. The agent is looking for an initial contact. He’s look specifically for two of something; two
                rings, two scarves, two knives, etc.. The place the twins are in signifies what line of work the person
                is in. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Left Ear: Counterfeiting</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Right Ear: Con Artist</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Neck: Assassination</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Right Bicep: Smuggling</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Right Wrist: Intimidation</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Left Wrist: Fence</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Stocking: Espionage</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Left Thumb & Pink: Interrogation</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Left Index: Trapfinding</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Left Middle Finger: Security</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Left Pinky: Kidnapping</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Right Index: Theft</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Right Middle: Forgery</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Right Ring Finger: Recon</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Right Index & Pink: Burglary</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>APPROACH & CONFIRMATION</strong> Now, because it’s
                entirely possible that someone wears two necklaces or two rings on their right index finger, the agent
                has to do an approach. This is usually a code phrase disguised as an innocuous sentence followed by an
                innocuous reply.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The key here is that often the two professionals don’t know who the other
                is, so an overtly familiar greeting from a strange is usually a give away they’re a master of the many
                trades.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The most common use of Thieves Cant is gathering information. In this case, after
                the confirmation they ask if you’d like to play cards.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The new thief then pays money into the pot for each card played, paying for the
                information he’s getting, as he asked about the other’s estates, friends, and family.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Hearts is safe, meaning he’s a friend and can be trusted, Diamond means you asked
                about a good mark, Clubs is heavily guard, and Spades means the person in question is looking for work.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The dealer may also talk about people, places, or things; the card he deals
                when he brings them up applying to them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Here’s some common Cant phrases:</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>"You settled down yet?": Are you working with a guild or are you
                    solo?</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>"How's your mother's health?": How difficult is the job?</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>"I think that tower's at least 14 spans high": You'll give me 14 sc for the
                    job</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>"No, you're crazy, I'm sure it's only 10": No, I won't. You'll get
                    10</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>"Aren't you a sight for sore eyes": Hide me</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>"Haven't seen you in awhile": Lay low</strong></p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This should be roleplayed out, with the player with Thieves Cant getting a
                Wisdom check to clarify anything that didn’t quite come through.</p>
            <h3>TOOL ADEPT</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 15</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When applying equipment to a Skill Check, you increase the dice it gives you
                by 1 size. If you're using equipment in a Conflict, you increase its Leverage dice size by 1 as well.
            </p>
            <h1>SOCIAL MASTERIES</h1>
            <h3>AGGRESSIVE FIGHTER</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Between the options of retreating and attacking, this person attacks, knowing, if
                there's any doubt, any hesitation on their part could make it worse. In a Morale Conflict, this
                character can't be forced to take defensive actions. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Mastery costs 5 CrP if you have a Trait that could be defined as
                Aggressive. You can't take this Mastery if you've taken the Defensive Fighter Mastery. </p>
            <h3>ANIMAL MAGNETISM</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 15</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some people have that inner force that comes with total confidence,
                allowing them to quickly put others on the back foot. In a Conflict, if you have higher Honor than your
                opponent, you automatically gain a point.</p>
            <h3>CRONY</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 15</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some people don't like the spotlight and are happy to help others. During a
                Conflict, if you rolled the least amount of dice in a round and your side still won the Appeal, you gain
                1 Honor.</p>
            <h3>DEFENSIVE FIGHTER</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Between the options of retreating and attacking, this person retreats,
                knowing, if there's any doubt, that the safest option is always to fall back and regroup. In a Morale
                Conflict, this character can't be forced to take aggressive actions. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This Mastery costs 5 CrP if you have a Trait that could be defined as
                Defensive. You can't take this Mastery if you've taken the Aggressive Fighter Mastery. </p>
            <h3>GOAL ORIENTED</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 15</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Where others are directed by their goals, this person directs them. If they
                have a Goal that relates to the Conflict, you gain 1 point for each Goal.</p>
            <h3>GOAL SYNERGY</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 15</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Goals working together is a beautiful thing and makes you more sure of your
                path. Reduce the Repercussion dice by 1 size per Goal that applies to the Conflict. If it would reduce
                it below a d3!, you’re automatically considered to have rolled a 1 on your Repercussions though this
                effect doesn’t stack.</p>
            <h3>IDIOSYNCRATIC</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 20</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some people don’t see the point of going against what they see as their
                true nature. A person with this Mastery gains an automatic +5 to their roll whenever they make an Appeal
                with a Flaw.</p>
            <h3>HARDENED RESOLVE</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 15</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When it comes down to the wire, this character doesn’t give up. Increase
                your Stress Threshold by 5.</p>
            <h3>NEVERMIND, FORGET IT</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 30</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sometimes you know you’re beaten and the only solution is to get out of
                there with at least some of your dignity intact. When you lose a Conflict, either by Folding or just
                simply backing out, you only lose half the Honor (rounded down) or gain half the Stress you otherwise
                would have.</p>
            <h3>RENAISSANCE MAN</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 10</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A true Renaissance man is a man (or woman) of many and powerful interests
                and they know how to use them to charm others. When you purchase this Mastery, designate a Passion; you
                can use it twice in a Conflict.</p>
            <h3>SPECIAL BOND</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 10*</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The battlefield can forge unlikely friendships, healing old scars by inflicting new
                ones on other people. These characters have put racial amenity aside and have grown to respect each
                other.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> This Mastery can only be taken by two characters who’s races don’t have a racial
                preference above Tolerate for each other. Their race is considered Preferred for each other, though this
                doesn’t extend to others of the same race.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> So, an elf and an orc that have gotten over their distrust for the other won’t cause
                each other Stress but that elf traveling with another orc will.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Both characters must pay the Mastery cost for it to take effect. Each
                person subtracts the max size of their Devotion die for each other from the price. So, a human who has a
                d12 Devotion to an orc can purchase this Mastery for 18 CrP.</p>
            <h3>STRONG OPENER</h3>
            <h3> CrP: 25</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A good opening salvo can really put you ahead and this character has a
                sense for it. If you beat (but not tie) your opponent in the first round, you gain 2 points.</p>
            <h5>Skills</h5>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Skills are used as a way to determine the success or failure of a given action,
                based on what your character knows about the given subject or about how to perform the given task. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You don’t have to use these rules all the time, i.e., you don’t have to
                roll to see if your character successfully walks across a room, but at times they’re a good way to
                semi-randomly determine the outcome of a tricky task, i.e., walking across a room full of traps. </p>
            <h1>SKILL INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> There are two types of skills that you’re going to be pulling from: Skill Suites and
                Advanced Skills.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Skill Suites represent broad swathes of knowledge that cover a variety of subjects.
                Suites are hard to increase because there’s so much ground to cover but can be used if you don’t have
                the specific Advanced Skill. An example of this is the Survival and Lore Skill Suites.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Advanced Skills are more tightly focused, covering one intellectual
                discipline. They’re easier to master but may not be applicable in every case. An example of this would
                be the First Aid, Fire Building, and Foraging skills in the Survival Skill Suite and the Arcana,
                History, and Medicine skills in the Lore Skill Suite.</p>
            <h3>ACQUIRING SKILLS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Throughout your character’s career, she’ll acquire and improve her skills.
                Both types of skills are purchased with CrP, that is spent either at Character Creation or on leveling
                up. All skills have a unique cost that represents how easy or difficult they are to master. You pay the
                price as noted in the section below, you improve the skill.</p>
            <h3>CALCULATING RANK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL SUITES </strong>Your Skill Suites, your starting
                Rank is the Skill Bonus listed under the corresponding Stat. For Suites with multiple Stats, average the
                Skill Bonus, rounded down. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ADVANCED SUITES </strong> Your starting Rank
                for Advanced Skills is the Rank for the mother Skill Suite.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PURCHASING A SKILL </strong>Advanced Skills cost their
                Base Cost - Skill Bonus + (Current Rank * 2), while Skill Suites cost their Base Cost Base Cost - Skill
                Bonus + (Current Rank * 5), both have a minimum of 1. Note that, like Skills Suites above, if there are
                multiple Stats attached to a Skill, average the Skill Bonus, rounded down.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Every purchase increases your Rank in that Skill by 1. Purchases of Skill
                Suites also raises the Rank of any child Advanced Skills you’ve already purchased, so that’s nice.</p>
            <h3>SKILL SPECIALIZATIONS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">It often pays to specialize. After all, many dissertations cover extremely minute
                subjects with incredible depth and drawing on that well of knowledge can be a huge benefit.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Skill Specializations represent an area of knowledge within an Advanced
                Skill that your character spends extra time versing themselves in. As such, they gain a bonus.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Skill specializations come in layers, modifiers that narrow down the field. Each
                layer gives a +1 to your effective Rank when it comes into play.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For example, a monster hunter studying predators, would gain a+1 Rank, while
                another that studies flying predators would gain a +2 Rank bonus to their checks, and a monster hunter
                that studies the flying predators of the Uchka Mountains would gain a bonus of +3 to their Rank.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">There may come a time when a specialization only kind of applies. In this case, it
                may be kind of helpful, as the max bonus that can be gained from it is +1.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, when encountering a land predator in the Uchka Mountains, all three
                monster hunters would only gain +1 to their Rank.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">That sort of super-focused study takes a lot of time and effort and man only
                has so much time and energy to give. The total number of specializations per Advanced Skill that a
                character can have is equal to half his Intelligence score.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">A character can gain a specialization like any other skill; having his character go
                out of the way to learn more about his craft. The price is the base cost of the Advanced Skill times the
                number of layers in the specialization plus one.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A character can go back and increase the number of layers in his Skill
                Specialization after his initial purchase of it, but it costs additional amount of CrPs equal to twice
                the base cost of the Advanced Skill.</p>
            <h1>THE BASICS (SKILL CHECKS)</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Before we go off talking about Skill Challenges, time, equipment, and all those other
                things, it’s first important to understand the very basic mechanic all of those things will hang off of:
                Skill Checks.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Skill Checks are any checks made that move the Skill Challenge along and determines a
                success or failure.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At their very basic, Skill Checks have both sides rolling a d20! and adding
                any applicable Skill’s Rank and any modifiers for difficulty. The person with the highest total wins and
                you successfully bypass or eliminate the Obstacle, depending on the situation.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">It is assumed that your character is trying their hardest to be successfully in
                whatever they attempt and so any Check you make inflicts 5 Stress. However, you can buy down that Stress
                with points off your total result on a 1 to 1 basis. You declare this before you get the results of the
                Check, however. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, let's you're making a Check to see if a pillar you're inspecting is load
                bearing. You have Rank 5 in Craft (Carpentry) and you roll an 18. Your total is 23 ( 18 + 5 ) but you're
                confident that you'll succeed due to the high roll so you tell the GM that you got a 21 total and take 3
                Stress, instead of 5. </p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Answering a Question</h2>
                    </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Another use of a single use Skill Check is answering a question
                            that you don’t know the answer to like “out of these two walls, which looks easier to
                            climb?” Things that would be reasonable for them to be there but you don’t know because you
                            didn’t prepare for that question.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h1>SKILL CHALLENGES</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Skill Checks refer to a single roll against a single Skill, while a Skill
                Challenge refers to a host of Skill Checks. To use a metaphor: a Skill Challenge would be breaking into
                the castle. The Skill Checks would be climbing the walls, hiding in the shadows, sneaking past the
                guards, listening at doors, lockpicking any locks, etc.</p>
            <h3>OBJECTIVES AND OBSTACLES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">A Skill Challenge doesn’t exist without something that your character wants and at
                least one thing that stands in their way.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">This could be something straightforward: I want to get out of this jail cell but a
                locked door is in my way, or it could be something more complicated like I want to capture this outlaw
                but he’s several days’ ride ahead of me.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These are your Objective and Obstacles, respectively.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Achieving your Objective is a matter of beating or getting past all the Obstacles in
                your way.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Obstacles are beaten through successfully rolling Skill Checks, which will be
                discussed more in the next section. Note that an Obstacle can continue to be a factor that needs to be
                considered, for example, a guard patrol, or it can be something that only needs to be taken care of
                once, for example, unlocking a door.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Obstacles also have Failure Threshold, which represents badly you have to
                fail against them to actually fail. More on this in the Failures, Hard & Soft section below.</p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <h2 class='sidebarTitle'>The Single Check</h2>
                    </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">Before we dive in, I think it's worth saying that there may be times when
                            you have something that might call for a Skill Check but not a Skill Challenge. Most often
                            you'll do this when there is danger but not a huge time crunch, like, for instance, players
                            leaping over a cliff or when there’s a chance of failure, like the player not knowing a
                            monster weakness.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">In that case, it would be perfectly reasonable to just call for a single
                            Jumping (or Monster Craft) Check. If the players want to do some Preparation or use any of
                            the other tools at their disposal, they can.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Or, if there is a time crunch but it is so narrow players really
                            wouldn't have the time to prepare, like having to jump the chasm while a horde of brigands
                            with bows are closing it, you might also just default to the single roll: no need to break
                            out these rules in that case.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In these cases, the Failure Threshold of the Check would be 1,
                            meaning a failure is a failure, but you can spice it up by having the jump almost make it
                            but now the player is just barely hanging out: however much time you want to spend on it.

                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">Let's say that you're trying to deduce facts about bears before you go to
                            fight one. The thing is, there is a lot to know about bears and your character probably
                            isn't going to know all of it, so making a single Check is too binary while making multiple
                            Checks is too tedious. </p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In steps the Mutli-Layer Check.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In this case, the GM would assign Difficulty Dice to the
                            different facts about bears based on how esoteric the knowledge is. He would then roll 1
                            d20! and all of those Difficulty Dice. You would only roll a single Check and the compare
                            that to the difference totals to see if you recall those facts. </p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">So, for instance, the knowledge that they habernate is no common but it's
                            not uncommon, do the GM assigns that d6!. The knoweldge that they're afraid of fire is
                            common, so he rolls d4! for that and the knowledge that they're sacred animals to the local
                            indigious tribe is pretty rare because said tribe is extremely secretative so that would be
                            a d20!. </p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">You roll your Monster Craft and get a total of 16. The GM gets a 13 for
                            the d20, a 4 for the d4!, a 5 for the d6! and a 1 for the second d20!. That means the totals
                            are 17, 18, and 14 respectively. This means your character hasn't really been around bears
                            to he doesn't know that they hibernate or that you can scare them with fire, however, he
                            does recall over hearing some of the wanderers in the local tavern talk about how the animal
                            was sacred to the local tribe and killed one of them after he wounded one of the creatures.
                        </p>

            </table>
            <h3>DIFFICULTY</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Difficulty is a dice that is added to the Skill Check based on things that might be
                going on at the time to either help or hinder your success.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, for example, finding food to eat while living off the land is much
                easier in a forest than it is in, say, a desert. In the forest, the players would receive a +d8! to
                their roll while in the desert the other side, the Obstacle, would get a +d20!. This is in addition to
                the base d20!, by the way.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Obstacles can have static, variable, shrinking, circular, growing, or "universal"
                difficulties. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STATIC </strong>means that the dice pretty much stays
                the same, outside of player interaction. This is often used for one off checks and not really used as
                the main part of a Skill Challenge because, let’s face it, doing the same Check over and over again
                isn’t that interesting.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>VARIABLE </strong>means that the Obstacle has multiple
                Checks associated with it but that the difficulty variables wildly over time. So, for instance, a rock
                wall that is slippery at the base, then has a section with a lot of handholds, and finishes with an
                overhang, would be three separate Checks, the first with a d12! difficulty for the wall, the next with a
                d4! for the players, and the final with a d10!, again for the wall.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHRINKING </strong>means that it starts high but then
                the dice shrinks as time passes, often becoming static at a certain point. This is when the threat
                becomes less and less severe, and I would use this sparingly and with other types of Obstacles, but it
                can represent the fact that leaving a place is often easier than getting in.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GROWING </strong>is the opposite of shrinking: it starts
                low and then increases as time passes, again, sometimes becoming static at a certain point. This is used
                to represent threats that continue to grow, often times when there is time pressure.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>UNIVERSAL </strong>This is a term for an Obstacle that
                will go off at sometime but won't be directly faced by the players. It represents a chance encounter,
                such as running into someone randomly, or a stroke of bad luck, like bad weather. Unlike other
                Obstacles, players won't make Checks directly against it but any Failure (or Success) against another
                Obstacle in that Challenge adds a like amount of Failure (or Success) to any Universal Obstacles.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CIRCULAR </strong>means it starts at a
                difficulty, grows to a certain difficulty, and then shrinks down to its original difficulty, rinse and
                repeat, ad nauseam. It can also start shrinking, if you’d like. This is often used as patrols, like
                guards and such, but also a monster stalking an area would be represented by this type of Obstacle
                though you would have it be a bit more random to represent that unpredictability.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">So, for instance, a guard patrol that makes a loop around the house would be a good
                example of a Circular Obstacle. When the patrol is furthest away from where the players are breaking in,
                the difficulty to not be detected by them is 0 so they add nothing to their roll, but when the guards
                are right on top of the players breaking in, the difficulty is +d20!. If it takes them 7 minutes to get
                from that furthest point to the players, that means every minute, the difficulty for the players
                increases by 1 dice size.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But, as the guards finish their circlate, heading back to the furthest point
                away from the players, the difficulty shrinks by 1 size per minute.</p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                <tr>

                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">The players don’t always have to be making Skill Checks during a Skill
                            Challenge - they should only do so when it makes sense.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">So, (using the above example) if the patrols aren’t very good and the
                            guards get too far away from the players to reasonably hear them, no Check should be
                            required.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But that doesn’t mean that time stops: if the players wait long
                            enough, the guards will return and Checks will need to start up again.</p>

            <h3>FAILURES, HARD & SOFT</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Failing a Check doesn’t automatically mean that you’re instantly screwed:
                Failing a single Move Silently Check doesn’t result in the guards catching you. In Bonfire, there are
                soft failures and hard failures.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Soft failures are when you fail a single Skill Check. How much you failed by is added
                to the Failure of the Obstacle you’re making the Check against and your Stress, while how much you
                succeed by due to help is just added to that Failure. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When that Failure goes over that Obstacle’s Failure Threshold, you get a
                hard failure for that Obstacle. Hard failures are when something bad actually happens. In this case, it
                does result in you getting caught by the guards, or it results in your falling off the wall and taking
                damage. Even after a hard failure, you can sometimes try again, like in the case of falling off the
                wall.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Failure doesn’t diminish during the Skill Challenge but it does reset for a
                new one.</p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">

                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Soft Failures don’t mean that the Skill Challenge grinds to a
                            halt while the players keep reattempting that Skill: instead it should represent the players
                            coming closer to danger.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">For a quick example, let’s say that there’s an adventurer, we’ll call him
                            New York Smith, York for short, who is attempting to jump a chasm, which has a Failure
                            Threshold of 10.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">He rolls his Check but fails by 7. In this case, he obviously
                            jumped but also didn’t make it. What does that mean? Well, New York didn’t quite make it but
                            managed to grab the ledge as he fell, so he didn’t fall to his death but he isn’t safe
                            either: the GM can make a roll for another Check to see if he can scramble up the sides, but
                            that probably won’t be a Jumping Check.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h3>ACTIVE & PASSIVE OBSTACLES</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Another thing to consider is whether or not the Obstacle is Active or
                Passives.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PASSIVE </strong>means that whomever you’re up against
                doesn’t realize they’re up against you. This is the, for example, the watchman doing his nightly rounds
                or the river you have to cross.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ACTIVE </strong>means that whomever you’re up against
                realizing something is amiss and is now actively working against you. This doesn’t mean you're caught:
                it just means the person is on high alert.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Inanimate objects can also become “Active” though. While not the most
                appropriate term for it, it still represents a dangerous situation that suddenly occurs that makes
                failure more deadly, such as having your safety line snap while climbing.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BECOMING ACTIVE AND PASSIVE </strong>Passive is the
                default state for an Obstacle to be in, so you don’t really need to do anything special.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">A Passive Obstacle becomes Active when you fail a Check against it.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Active Obstacle adds the amount of Failures it has to its Check, making it that much
                harder to succeed against it.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">An Active Obstacle goes back to being Passive if you succeed at a Skill
                Check without any help (outside of Honor).</p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">

                            Characteristic that affects how diligent they are, but what about players? A person, NPC or
                            not, gains 3 Stress for every hour they remain Active, so yeah, your players can remain ever
                            vigilant but they'll be mental wrecks in a week or so.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">What about if the players want to come back to try again? They
                            can with any Active penalty they gained diminishing by 3 for every hour the Obstacle is
                            Passive.</p>

                        <p style="margin:0px;">Much like in a Social Conflict, your character is probably going to get
                            Stress Dice. Note that, unless it says otherwise, that dice is a d6!.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">When any of these tools note that you roll a Stress Dice, if you don’t
                            have one, you simply gain one that then waits in the wings to be rolled the next time you
                            roll a tool. You can gain multiple Dice this way without rolling them.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At the end of Challenge, you roll all Stress Dice and add it to
                            your Character’s Stress.</p>

            <h3>ASSETS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">These represent static pools of knowledge or information that you can pull from. So,
                for instance, a book on the subject, or a library are examples of an Asset but also an old friend who
                used to be a ranger could give you a few pointers so could give you a bonus to the Navigation Check
                you’re going to have to make to find those ruins. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Basically, anything you can think of that might apply might be an Asset you can draw
                on.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Assets add their Skill Rank to your Check, however this happens slowly based on that
                Asset's Time Investment. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For each period of the Time Investment you spend with the Asset, you gain a
                +1 to one of your future Checks, up until the Asset's Rank.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">So, you go to your old ranger friend to get information about the local area. You
                know he happens to be a talker, so you know it’ll take you at least 2 hours (his Time Investment) to
                start to get anything useful out of him so you decide to spend the day with him, spending about 8 hours
                there.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Now, your friend doesn’t remember as much as he used to so his Navigation is Rank 3.
                After spending 8 hours with him, you get a +3 to your Navigation Prep Check. If you have stayed 6 or 7
                hours, you would have still gotten that +3, while if you had stayed for 2 hours, you would have only
                gotten only a +1.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You don’t automatically know the Rank or the Time Investment of an Asset.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Another benefit of Assets is that they allow you to do multiple Preparation
                for a single Skill Check and the same Asset can be used to Prepare for multiple different checks. A
                library, for example, could allow you to Prepare for both a Monster Craft and History check.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Assets can also be increased and expanded upon as well, increasing its Rank. A good
                relationship with a contact might give you information quicker, donating to the local library may
                increase its selection, or hiring excavators to dig up a ruin may unearth more artifacts that help you
                decipher that ancient script.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There may be some special cases where an Asset will take care of itself but
                you may have to check back on it, such as Snaring in the forest. You set your trap and then a day or two
                later, you can go back and check it to see if you caught anything - in the meantime, you can get other
                work done.</p>

                            use each other's characters as Assets and why shouldn't they? So, in this case, the Time
                            Investment is set at 2 hours and 45 minutes - the character's Intellect * 3 in minutes. This
                            means that a character with an Intellect of 13 has a Time Investment of 2 Hours, 6 Minutes.

                            full hour+ planning.GMs should also feel free to reward players who sit there and talk

                            really use Snaring or if you don’t have the proper tools or a woodshop, Maintenance won’t do
                            you any good. This will need to be handled on a case to case basis.</p>

            <h3>EQUIPMENT</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Your kit can really pull you through in a pinch.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Players are assumed to be using any and all equipment that would help them with a
                check and you can choose to have one or more of these pieces of equipment to give you, in that moment, a
                reroll one of one your dice (taking the better of the two). You can have multiple pieces of equipment
                apply but the reroll can only be redeemed once per Check.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">On top of this, if the gear you’re using has Traits that applies, you add any of
                those applicable bonuses to whichever roll you keep.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">For the first redemption of this bonus between Maintenance Prep Checks this comes
                with no penalty but every time after that, the tool degrades, giving it a -1 regardless of whether you
                succeed or not. While players are assumed to be using all equpment that might be useful without having
                to specifically state as such, if a player did point out how a piece of equipment is being used to help
                them, they're automatically considered to have made a Maintenace Check before using it if they have that
                Skill.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can use faulty equipment (ones with a negative modifier), since
                something is better than nothing. This still gives you a reroll but it’s on 1 dice lower (again, keeping
                the better of the two).</p>
            <h3>HELPER SKILLS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Let’s say that you’re tracking someone in the wilderness. You have Hunting at Rank 4
                and Endurance at Rank 3. Seems like being able to move quickly over a longer period of time, should help
                you catch the guys and it does. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you have another Advanced Skill that you think might help you, you can
                add it for the normal Stress Dice penalty and roll a Stress Dice.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This may seem like it is nearly identical to Preparation, and they are very
                close. The difference is that Preparation is a general thing that applies to a Skill Check you’re going
                to make in the future, while using a helper Skill is in the moment and is specific to the scenario. You
                can use both at the same time, since the help Skill gives a bonus and Preparation gives a reroll.</p>

                            Stress Dice add their Rank to help out. </p>

            <h3>MULTI-TASKING</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Let’s be realistic here: you’re probably going to end up trying to do two things at
                once, like climbing a wall and doing so quietly.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If that’s the case, you’re going to have to “split” your d20! into smaller
                dice and assign those to each of the Checks you’re trying to make, because your attention is divided.
                The total max value of the dice can never exceed 20 but it can be lower than it. The other side will
                still be rolling full d20!s against you.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">So, if you’re climbing a wall and trying to do so quietly, you’d have to make a
                Climbing and a Move Silently Check. You could split it like so: d12! for Climbing and d8! for Move
                Silently, or d10! for Climbing and d10! for Move Silently, or d12!+d4! for Move Silently and d4! for
                Climbing.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Or you could just say “screw being quiet” and roll a d20! for Climbing and
                take a 0 for Move Silently. In this case, the GM would just roll against your Skill Rank. So, if you
                choose to ignore Move Silently but have a Rank 4 in it, the GM would roll their dice, and you can hope
                they don’t roll higher than 4.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Either way, besides this, it works like a normal Check</p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Helping Others</h2>
                    </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">It feels good to help people and Bonfire is all about group cooperation.
                            The fighter helps the skill monkey survive combat and the skill monkey helps the fighter not
                            look like an idiot while doing detective work.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">And how you help other characters will really depend on the
                            situation. Perhaps your Preparation can be used to help another person hide or perhaps you
                            have a bit of knowledge that they don’t.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">Really, this will be done to what feels right in the moment but this note
                            is here to draw attention to someone helping you as an Asset and someone adding their Rank
                            to yours with a Helper Skill, and how they’re different. </p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">And the difference is time. If you have plenty of time to coach someone
                            while they’re climbing a cliff face, you’d be an Asset and nobody would take a Stress Die.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But if you’re being chased by the guards and it’s a matter of
                            seconds or minutes, you’d add a Helper Skill and both of you would need to take the Stress
                            Die.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that if the skill monkey is also trying to climb the cliff
                            face and coach as they go, that would be considered a d10! worth of effort for
                            Multi-Tasking, though you don’t have to actually roll to see if you help. </p>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <h3>PREPARATION</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Preparation is anything your character does to help a specific Skill Check that will
                be made in the future (even if that future is 2 seconds from now). Note that this doesn't have to be a
                Check you make: it can also apply to an ally's Check (if it makes sense).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Usually, these only take a couple of seconds but can vary widely depending
                on the circumstances. Throwing a rock is a matter of moments while constructing a gilly suit will take a
                lot longer.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">As long as there is time, there is no chance of failure or, if the players have
                plenty of time, Preparation just happens. Mark what you did for later in the Skill Challenge.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">However, if there is a time crunch or a chance of failure, Preparation works like a
                normal Skill Check.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Either way, you only get one Prep Check per Advanced Skill that applies for each
                upcoming Check, unless you have Assets but remember that they do take time.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">That means that if you know you're going to have to make a jump, you can use
                Acrobatics to stretch, Endurance to do a few practice sprints to the edge, and Sports (long jumping) to
                remember techniques all to prep for the same Jump check.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When you redeem Preparation that you’ve readied, you can reroll one of the
                dice that was rolled for the Check. This means either the base dice or the difficulty dice for either
                you or the Obstacle.</p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Planning & Action Phases</h2>
                    </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">While it isn’t entirely black and white, it’s helpful to think of
                            Challenges as composing two phases: planning and action; the laying out the plan and then
                            the heist.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">Planning is gathering intel, getting your team and equipment together,
                            and planning your route of attack. This is where you’ll use Preparation, Taking Your Time,
                            and Assets mostly.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">Action phase is when you’ll be doing a lot of the Checks and Stress, as
                            well as equipment and companions - using what you learned in the Prep Phase to help you get
                            through the sticky parts.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But don’t get too hung up on separating these ideas though. Even
                            during the heist, you might find it worth your time to sit on your heels and take your time
                            while doing some Preparation as there will almost certainly be problems that crop up that
                            you need to adjust to.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h3>RUSHING IT</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">On the flipside, if you’re in a hurry to get the job down, you can just rush it. This
                subtracts 50% from the estimated time but gives you a -5. Like Taking Your Time, this can be done
                multiple times in a row to half the time again but it also increases the penalty by 1.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Failures don’t consider this -3 while determining the extent of your failure
                and success means you bought yourself some more time: removing the amount you succeed by, with the -3,
                from the Failure on one of the Obstacles.</p>
            <h3>TAKING YOUR TIME</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">The other thing that you can do is take your time and really try and do the job well.
                Doubling the time for your Check gives you a +6. This can be done multiple times in a row to gain a
                further bonus but each time lowers the bonus by 1, down to +0. Regardless of how long you take your
                time, you always only roll 1 Stress Dice.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if it would take you 15 minutes to search a room, you could take 30
                minutes instead and get a +6, or 60 minutes for a total of +11 ( 6 + 5 ).</p>
            <h3>WAITING IT OUT</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">By doing nothing, you can calm your nerves and let who you’re facing do the same.
                This can be by either finding a shadow to hunker down in or finding a spot in the wall where you can
                rest while climbing.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Using this tool allows you to half the current Active penalty. You can also take
                points from that Active penalty and add them to the Failure against that Obstacle, though you can’t push
                the Obstacle above its Failure Threshold. You do roll 1 Stress Dice either way.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This may or may not work on an inanimate Obstacle but you need to use your
                best judgement.</p>

                repelling up and down walls of various heights and textures.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Difficulty should be based on height, with about every 40 ft increasing the
                difficulty by 1. Textures should also play a major factor in not just how tough the check is but also
                how many checks need to be made for a given wall.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, if there’s a wall, where the base is stone at a 45% slant for 20 ft,
                then it moves to close knit stones for another 40 ft, and then finally to a wood overhang for just 5 ft,
                and then to a wooden wall for 10 ft, there would be 4 Climbing checks in this order: Trivial,
                Challenging (Average for base but because it’s 40 ft, it gets bumped up 1), Challenging, and Easy.</p>

                you’re in a hurry, you can half that time but you increase the difficult by 1 each time you do so. So,
                reducing the time to 7 minutes, would bump a Trivial trap up to Average in difficulty.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A failure indicates that you set the trap off accidentally.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ENDURANCE</strong> Through training, a character can
                push his body past the limits of his base physical ability. The Rank of this Skill is the number of
                seconds between taking damage while Running or Sprinting.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If a character is not trained specifically in this Advanced Skill, default
                to their Athletics Skill Suite Rank.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ESCAPE ARTIST</strong> This allows the character to
                escape bonds and restrictions and is always rolled opposed, either against the Rope Use skill of the
                person who tied them or against the quality of the manacles or binds the person was put in.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The character can make a straight Average check, not to break the bounds or
                get free, but to instead move his body to an advantageous position.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>JUMPING</strong> You need to cover a distance without
                touching the ground: jump.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> For every point you scored under what you needed, you travel either 2 ft
                horizontally or 1 ft vertically. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Jumping from a stand still is an Average check, while doing so with a
                running start is an Easy check. Add 1 to your roll for every Level of Fatigue your character has.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SPORT (specific)</strong> This covers the
                actually playing of a specific sport as well as an in-depth knowledge of the game’s rules and famous
                players and techniques. If it becomes a plot point, the GM should feel free to make this skill apply to
                only certain positions, like pitching or shortstop.</p>

            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MOVE SILENTLY</strong> When you want to move
                silently, you’ll want to use this skill. This involves being able to feel your way along and compensate
                for creaks.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is always an opposed check vs any potentially listener’s Listening,
                with a failure indicating that the listener has heard something suspicious, though the person attempting
                Move Silently may not be aware that they were detected. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SWIMMING</strong> This skill allows a character to not
                drown in water. Without at least basic training in this skill, a character can’t attempt to swim with
                simply an Athletics check.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The difficulty of the check is determined by the water (or other liquid, I
                don’t judge) you’re attempting to swim in, though simply trying to float on your back and letting the
                current take you reduces the difficulty by 2, though it is risky because you could get pulling into an
                aquifer and drowned that way or get pulled over a waterfall.</p>
            <h3>LORE SKILL SUITE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This suite covers general knowledge, which is mostly academic in nature.
                Most of it is pretty heavy stuff but the basics are second nature or stuff that’s been picked up here
                and there.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ADMINISTRATION</strong> While they’ll never inspire the
                awe or respect that other leaders do, people who oversee the day to day functions of an organization
                keep the lights on so that others can make the speeches.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Administrators can make an Average skill check to gain a clue about an item the
                party might need on their adventure, or a Challenging one to retroactively remember that they did buy an
                item back at the market for just such an occasion.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each of these checks they make increases the difficulty of the next one by
                1 step.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ARCANA</strong> The science of magic is an oft studied
                but little understood branch of Lore that requires a deep knowledge of the nature of the Painted World.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> With this skill, someone can identify a spell, point out needed regents and
                processes for ritual castings, detect if something is magical, or even detect if a spell has been cast
                in an area, and have a chance of finding out what it was.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> All of these, except for the last two, are Average checks, with detecting
                whether or not a spell was cast in an area is Trivial + 1 for every day since the casting, or to detect
                what specific spell it was, Challenging + 1 for every day since the casting.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HISTORY</strong> Everyone knows certain large events,
                but few can tie those events into an overarching narrative and understand their effects on later events.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The History skill allows a character to not just recall events but also to
                link them to the present day, to certain traditions and rituals of a culture, or the behavior of certain
                members of a culture, giving insight on how to proceed.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LANGUAGE (specific)</strong> A character receives this
                skill for free in their native tongue at double their Rank in Lore and it allows them to speak and be
                understood by others with skill in that language.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Checks are only made when timing is critical, such as communication in a battle, or
                when understanding is key, such as when debating foreign policy.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> If one of the characters is in a Social Conflict with another in a tongue that’s not
                their native one, that person can only bring in as many Characteristic Die per round as he has Ranks in
                that Language.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Additionally, when two native speakers are in a Conflict, the one with the
                higher Language Rank gains Leverage (see Applicable Skills under the Leverage Advance Rule in
                <strong>Chapter 9: Social</strong> ). In case of tie, nothing happens.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Lore Skill Suite can’t be used in place of a Language Check for tongues
                you don’t know unless you have the Language Skill in a related Language. Using a real world example,
                someone with the Language (Swedish) Advanced Skill couldn’t use the Lore Skill Suite to understand a
                person with Language (French) but could use it when talking to someone with Language (Norwegian) or
                Language (Danish). </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LAW (culture)</strong> This skill covers the intricacies
                of the legal system, including landmark rules and common punishments for common crimes. A character can
                make their case or find loopholes to exploit the legal system.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A character’s Lore skill can only be used to substitute in for their native
                culture but not others. If the character does wish to branch out, his mastery of Law for that culture
                starts at 0, as he must learn everything from the ground up. Diving more into his own culture’s laws
                (buying this Advanced Skill for his culture) uses the Lore skill as base, as per usual.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LITERACY (language)</strong> Unlike other skills, this
                skill can’t be attempted unless you’ve specifically bought this Advanced Skill and it’s mastery starts
                at 0. That’s right; every character starts illiterate.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This skill allows a character to read and write in a language’s alphabet,
                giving them the power to pen books and poems, or passive aggressive notes.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MATHEMATICS</strong> While this may seem like just a
                skill that allows you to be able to juggle figures and add totals and calculate the area of a circle
                like a huge nerd, Mathematics has a more practical use: correctly guessing distances.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While you can try to eyeball how far away something is, an Average
                Mathematics check allows you to do rough calculations, giving you the ability to know exactly what
                penalty you’re going to get for using a ranged weapon or who’s going to be affected by the Area of
                Effect of a spell you’re going to cast.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MEDICINE</strong> With proper treatment and nursing, a
                wound that would lay you out for weeks, may only keep you down for a couple of days. This skill involves
                the knowledge of long term care, when bandages should be changed, which poultices will have the greatest
                effect, and what minor surgeries need to be performed.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> A character with this skill can make a Check for a wounded person, added the
                Severity of any Wounds that he's treating to the opposing roll. So, if a person has a 5, 3, and 8
                Severity Wound, he can make a Medicine Check vs d20+16 or he can choose not to treat the 8 Severity
                Wound and make a vs d20!+8. Success means that the person can take 1 day off the healing time for that
                Wound every time it drops a Severity.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> So, a success against a 5 Severity Wound means that is was treated properly and
                takes 10 days to completely heal ( 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 ) instead of the normal 15.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">You may also increase the Difficulty modifier by half again as much - if you succeed,
                you take 2 days off per Severity. So, if you're against a d20!+9, you can make it a d20!+14 ( 9 + ( 9 /
                2 ) ) for that bonus.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Additionally, a Check vs the a Poison, Toxin, or Disease's Lethality allows
                character to reroll their save.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MONSTER CRAFT</strong> This Advanced Skill is under both
                the Lore and Survival Skill Suite but still counts as 1 skill, so you don’t have to buy it twice - they
                share their Rank. It simply represents the different ways that each Skill Suite approaches the craft.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Monster Craft gives you insight into the creatures that roam the Middle Realm.
                Starting with something simple, such as their name, and the progressively learning more and more about
                them, such as they’re are fundamentally two different types of Incorporeal Undead or that you can
                convince Demons to do things if you win a Conflict with them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The knowledge should be fairly general - weaknesses or where they draw their power
                from, so it will never reveal anything meta such as what the monster’s attack or Vitality is but it can
                let you know if the creature is known for having a lot of Vitality or is good at hitting.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each Monster Craft check starts as an Average Skill Check and answers one
                question the player has on a success but each successive check on the same monster increases the
                difficulty by 2. On top of this, for rare creatures or hard questions, the GM may up the Difficulty as
                she feels is appropriate.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NATURE</strong> This area of study covers the topography
                of the Middle Realm. It’s forests and rock formations and biomes. It helps predict whether or not it’s
                going to rain or whether the next summer is going to be a hot one.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Predicting what’s coming in the next hour is a Trivial check, with the
                difficulty increasing by 1 for each time you double the prediction window. So, detecting the weather in
                the next 2 hours is Easy, while doing so in the next 16 hours is a Hard check.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RELIGION (cult)</strong> This skill acquaints the
                character with a knowledge of cults, their common Covenants and Miracles, as well as their hierarchies,
                means of advancement and important members.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> It also allows a character to gain a knowledge of their rituals and sacrifices, as
                well as the taboos of their clergy and how to appease their heavenly messengers and avenging angels.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The Religion Skill is taken for a single Covenant, but can purchased independently
                for different Covenants.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A character adds the tens digit of this skill to their chance of gaining
                Favor when making sacrifices to the god of that cult.</p>
            <h3>STREETWISE SKILL SUITE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This suite covers knowledge that a character might pick on the street or in
                the school of hard knocks. While Lore is book smart, Streetwise is street smart.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CURRENT AFFAIRS</strong> A character with this
                skill is well informed about the day to day affairs of regional powers and men and woman of importance,
                their dealings and alliances, as well as their hatreds. He can pick out celebrities and know how and why
                someone got rich and famous. They can also use this skill to guess the Honor category of someone by
                watching how people react to them.</p>
            <table style="width:330px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px">

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DECEPTION</strong> This covers all sort of deception,
                where you want the person to believe opposite the truth, or, to put it simply, when you want to lie to
                them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The level of difficulty to pull off a lie is based on how much of what you’re saying
                isn’t the truth, strictly speaking. This is always opposed by either the other character’s Deception or
                Perception but only if the character has reason to suspect that you’re lying to them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Even if you succeed, this isn’t a permanent way of changing their mind. New
                evidence presented to that person may cause them to rethink their opinion on what you tried to sell them
                so be careful about what falsehoods you spin.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FORGERY</strong> Mostly commonly used for creating fake
                currency, forgery is a skill that allows a character to reproduce something effectively and fool others.
                This skill acquaints the character with common forging techniques and knowledge with what possible
                agents will being looked for.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The forger must also have the appropriate corresponding Craft or Trade skill, so he
                can’t forge coins if he doesn’t have the Metalworking skill, though that’s within reason: a character
                forging an official passport with one at hand doesn’t need to have Literacy as he can just copy the
                letters, though he may also need to have Artistry (wood cutting) to create the heraldry on it, but
                someone trying to forge an official declaration from skratch does need to have the Literacy skill in
                that language plus Artistry (wood cutting).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Forgery is opposed by Perception, the applicable skill, or Forgery but only
                if the character looking has reason to suspect there’s something else. A lazy guard probably won’t check
                your passport too closely right before lunch, but a particularly astute one who’s on the lookout for a
                promotion will, thus granting him a check. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GAMBLING/GAMING</strong> This skill doesn’t
                give the character a gift for winning games, just that he knows the rules and knows the odds, which
                could in turn lead to him winning the game. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INTUITION</strong> The ability to understand people and
                get where they're coming form can help you figure out what will and won't work with them better. A
                Trivial Intuition check allows the character to get a feel for how open a person would be to a Conflict
                over something or what would be definite dealbreakers. It doesn't reveal any of their Characteristics or
                their strengths as it's more of gut feeling than anything.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each check on the same person increases the Difficulty by 1. To gain this
                insight, they must either watch them for a total of 3 hours + 1 hour for every additional thing they
                wish to learn, or talk to them for 10 minutes + 5 minutes for every additional. You can speed up the
                learning process, but 1 hour or 5 minutes, respectively, but doing so also increases the difficulty by
                1. This time doesn't have to be in one sitting or done purposeful and more represents the fact that the
                person making the check needs to be familiar with the person on some leve.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LISTENING</strong> While Perception handles the
                other senses, Listening has to deal with your character’s auditory senses. This goes beyond simply
                hearing something: listening allows the character to know when an otherwise innocuous noise is actually
                something to pay attention to though it might not always be apparent why at first. </p>

            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LOCK PICKING</strong> It takes a lot more know how then
                you might think to pick a lock. The amount of time it takes to pick any lock is based on your skill
                level and the quality of the lock. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Subtract the Time Off x how much you succeeded your check by from the Base
                Time.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PERCEPTION</strong> This covers four of the five senses
                that a character has: sight, touch, taste, and smell. Technically, your character is always receiving
                inputs from these senses but Perception helps filter out the most important ones. Can he detect if there
                are orcs in the nearby bush? Can she taste the hidden poison in her drink before she swallows? These are
                all Perception checks</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Like Listening, sometimes Perception will help the character notice
                something that may be important, even if it’s not obvious why it’s grabbing your attention.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SLEIGHT OF HAND</strong> This skill covers all
                things that require you to do quick, delicate movements with your fingers. This may be slipping a card
                up your sleeve, picking a pocket, or doing cat’s cradle while bored.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRAP FINDING</strong> This actually covers a lot more
                than simple detecting trip wires or arrow holes in a dungeon. This can detect pits and snares, as well
                as buttons disguised as bricks or switches hidden as sconces.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A character can sweep an entire room with a Hard check but a character may
                be awarded a modifier secretly by the GM if they point out 2 or 3 spots they want to pay extra close
                attention to if one or more of those places actually houses the trap. Obviously, you don’t earn that
                modifier if you just name everything in the room and the more specific you are with what you’re
                searching, the higher that modifier should be.</p>
            <h3>SURVIVAL SKILL SUITE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This suite covers everything that a character might need to survive in the
                wild; Knowledge of what plants to eat and the skills to hunt and breed animals.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BOTANY</strong> This gives a knowledge of what the herbs
                used in cooking, alchemy, and medicine look like in their natural environment and it allows you to
                identify their common uses.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Mostly, this is used for detecting poisonous plants, which is a Trivial
                check, but someone with the Medicine skill can also find any local plants that might help him in his
                cures with an Average check, lowering his Medicine check by 1 if succeeds.</p>

            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CAMOUFLAGE</strong> This involves more than just ducking
                behind a crate or sliding into the shadow of a doorway; the skill of camouflage represents a character’s
                ability to blend into their surroundings, given enough time and patience. It also always them to help
                others hide more effectively as well. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Assuming that the character has time and equipment to do so, a character gains his
                skill percentage in Camouflage to his Hiding temporary. Additionally, under the same conditions, he can
                also give this bonus to other’s Hiding checks.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When used to hide something in plain sight, like a cart, building, or
                weapon, he may roll a check based on its size.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FIRE BUILDING</strong> Against the cold, lonely nights
                out in the wild, there is only the fertility symbols you carve for yourself and the roar of the fire.
                This skill allows you to build one of those things: the fire.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Under normal conditions, it takes about 30 minutes and a Trivial check to
                setup and light a fire, assuming you don’t have to go far out of your way to find the wood.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FIRST AID</strong> This gives the character a crude
                understanding of battlefield medicine: making splints and staunching wounds.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> A character with this skill can make a Check for a person wounded in that last 30
                minutes, added the Severity of any Wounds that he's treating to the opposing roll. So, if a person has a
                5, 3, and 8 Severity Wound, he can make a First Aid Check vs d20+16 or he can choose not to treat the 8
                Severity Wound and make a vs d20!+8. Success means that the person can take 1 level of Severity off
                those Wounds. So a 5 Severity Wound drops immediately to a 4 Severity Wound. You cannot go back and do a
                Check for a Wound that you skipped.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You have 30 minutes to preform First Aid Checks for a person, which each
                Wound taking 3 minutes to see to, if appliable. You may also increase the Difficulty modifier by half
                again as much - if you succeed, you hit 2 points of damage. So, if you're against a d20!+9, you can make
                it a d20!+14 ( 9 + ( 9 / 2 ) ) to heal 2 points of damage. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HANDLE ANIMAL (specific)</strong> This skill deals with
                the handling and care of a specific animal, from birth to the slaughter house. It also deals with
                training and common illnesses to make sure the stock is healthy and viril.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The base price of this skill is calculated towards domesticated animals. If
                the player wishes to learn how to deal with wild animals, this skill costs thrice as much to purchase.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HIDING</strong> This allows a character to make
                the most of a situation or environment to cloak themselves against prying eyes. This is always opposed
                by Perception, with the difficulty determined by the area. Character can also use this to instantly get
                an idea of how well they can hide in the given space.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MONSTER CRAFT</strong> This skill is the same
                as the Monster Craft under the Lore Skill Suite. Look there for details on it.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NAVIGATION</strong> Either using the stars or the
                position of the moons and sun, this character can track their way even through the most untamed
                wilderness without getting lost. It also allows them to tell the time.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Without proper equipment, a character can only give rough estimations of
                where they are, anchored on larger geographic feature (like mountains or rivers but not towns or roads)
                to the nearest 10 miles.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SCAVENGING</strong> There’s a gift in high speed
                appraisal. This is often used by those picking over battlefields for anything they could sell, but it’s
                also found a niche with adventurers who use it to find food and sustainance while traveling away from
                civilization.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> A Trivial check tells a character which of two things considered is worth more. This
                can’t be used for coinage, but can be any other type of good. It also gives the character an idea of
                whether broken equipment can be reasonably salvaged.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This doesn’t give even a ballpark of what anything is worth but it only
                takes a few seconds of consideration. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SNARING</strong> This teaches the character how to
                properly create and place snares to trap smaller wildlife. It also gives some cursory knowledge on the
                best places to put them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A successful Trivial check nets 1 lbs of usable game meat at the end of the
                day, with the amount you can catch increasing by 1 for each additional difficulty.</p>

                down your query in one go, and so the hunt is on as your watch for subtle signs of their passing. While
                this skill was originally used to hunt wildlife, it has been repurposed by wardens and bounty hunters
                trying to capture the most dangerous game. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The base for a Hunting check is Average difficulty, however, a lot of
                different factors play into a hunt. Each condition either raises or lowers the difficulty by the noted
                amount. These are not all the conditions that come into play but it should give you a good base line.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> On a failure, the Tracker loses the trail for a number of days equal to the amount
                they failed by. They must double back and can try a second check after the time elapsed to see if
                they’ve found the trail again. Should they fail the second time, they’ve completely lost the trail.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If your query is actively trying to hide their tracks, it becomes opposed
                by the query’s Hunting skill. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>USE ROPE</strong> Covering all kinds of knots and
                bindings, the Use Rope skill is pretty self explanatory, though it should be noted that you can also use
                this skill to get a sense of the tensile strength of a rope or how much you’re going to need for a
                certain job.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> To keep your players on their toes, I suggest you make the check, not when
                they tie the knot, but when it’s tested. </p>
            <h3>TACTIC SKILL SUITE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Combat isn’t just about raw physical power, but more about how it’s
                directed and used. This Skill Suite deals with logistics and making the most out of what you have.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COMBAT STYLE (style)</strong> By studying the best
                tactics and how to fight in certain circumstances, a warrior can take advantage of his surroundings and
                combat styles emerge. Combat Styles can be anything but involve to parts: a situation and a metric. This
                situation is when the Combat Style is most effective. For instance, it can be “in the forest”, “fighting
                on rooftops”, “being outnumbered”, “being in a duel”, “fighting while prone”, etc.. Really anything (as
                long as your GM approves). The second part of the Combat Style is the metric is applied to. This can be
                anything you could normally specialize in. Both the situation and metric are selected at the time of
                purchase and cannot be changed.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> If the situation is applicable, the character receives a +1 to that metric for every
                2 Ranks of that skill he’s obtained.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So a character with the Combat Skill (unarmed fighting, attack) at 5 who
                gets into a tavern brawl gets a +2 to attack as long as he doesn’t draw his weapon and simply uses
                fisticuffs.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Having a high Rank in Tactics doesn't automatically give you Combat Style
                bonuses under all circumstances and buying this skill for the first time starts it off at Rank 0,
                instead of the Tactic Suite's Rank. </p>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DISTRACTION</strong> More than simply yelling “hey,
                look” at someone, the art of distraction is the art of holding people’s attention.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The amount of time that someone is delayed is based on the difficulty of
                the check and how bent on their current activity they are.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The time given below is the time between checks, however, each successive check gets
                1 difficulty harder, with the same result. So, distracting someone for 1d3 minutes the first time is
                Average, but the next 1d3 minutes you’re trying to hold their attention is Challenging. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This skill is less effective when the person knows they’re in immediate
                danger. In this case, as long as they’re not actively engaged in melee with someone, the time is reduced
                to equivalent amount of seconds. So, a successful Challenging check only delays someone for 1d4 seconds
                instead. Each successive check gets 2 difficulties harder in these cases.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LEADERSHIP</strong> The difference between a leader and
                an administrator is that the latter gets stuff done and the former gets others to get stuff done but
                hooking into what they believe and how they view themselves. Assuming you have a willing audience, you
                may make an Average Leadership skill check vs a social characteristic you think the person or group
                might have. If you succeed the check and they have the characteristic you’re looking for (or close
                enough - you don’t have to be exact), you increase their Morale by a number of points equal to the
                maximum value of one of the dice of that characteristic. So, a 3d4 Trait will only net 4 points of
                Morale.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can increase the number of characteristics you’re aiming for by
                increasing the difficulty of the check by a like number, but the audience only gains the bonus from the
                largest of the characteristics.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>QUARTER MASTERING</strong> There’s an art to
                packing and making sure that everyone is well fed and prepared. If a the quartermaster is using a
                personal container of any kind, he adds 2S for each Rank he has in this Skill. Otherwise, he adds 1S per
                Rank. This also applies to any person he packs for. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RALLY</strong> When manure hits the windmill,
                no speeches or grand narratives will keep a person from bolting. Only the cold will of a competent
                commander can keep a battle from becoming a route. A captain who successfully makes a Check for someone
                who is currently over their Stress Threshold, heals that person a number of Stress equal to his Rank.
                This is opposed by the enemy captain, if appliable, and each Check against the same target increases the
                Difficulty by 1, regardless of whether it was successful or not.</p>

            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RECRUITING</strong> Knowing where to find the right
                person is a crucial skill for any long term expedition. A character with this skill can find a random
                person willing to hire on with a Trivial check in a number of days equal to their roll.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Now, finding specialists or someone with a certain skill is another matter. Every
                additional criteria adds 1 level of difficulty to the search.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Where you’re looking also makes a difference, as well.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This doesn’t guarantee that the person found will take the job or doesn’t
                have some serious issues, like a crippling fear of dogs: it only guarantees that they have the skills
                you’re looking for and that they’re somewhat interested in being hired on. Pay and comfort make a lot of
                difference to a prospective hire.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RIDING</strong> This skill teaches a character how to
                maintain their stability while on horseback and making them capable of feats of equine prowess.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The bonuses for this Skill are varied and many with the specifics spelled out in
                <strong>Chapter 10: Combat</strong> under the Mounted Combat section so they won't be listed here.
                Seriously, go check it out.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SIGNALLING</strong> This is the knowledge of how to
                communicate over long distances, either using semaphore, smoke signals, signal lamps, or horn blowing.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When using this means of communication, each side rolls a check based on
                how complicated the message is and how quickly they need to send it. Signalling is an ad hoc language
                with no grammatical rules or complicated tenses and so even at the best of times, only simple messages
                can be sent.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WARFARE</strong> The Warfare skill hands directing
                troops on the battlefield, weighing options and devising plans on the fly. Those with this skill can
                roll it to temporarily pause combat to ask one question and receive one answer from a specific member of
                the party, or to simply tell them something. On top of this, you can also use this, out of combat, to
                confer with players who’re characters are not present in the scene.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Checks start at Trivial but increase by 1 difficulty each time they’ve been rolled
                that combat.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Warfare also has additional benefits and uses that will be outlined in
                Crowns of Fire, the kindgom management and mass combat supplement for Bonfire Advanced.</p>
            <h3>TRADES SKILL SUITE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This suite covers the crafting and creating skills. While there are a wide
                array and breathe of professions, this list is pared down to those areas of knowledge where the common
                man and the adventurer overlap in their needs.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>APPRAISAL (specific)</strong> It’s wise to know what
                something is worth before selling and buying it. This skill handles that and is taken for a specific
                type of good, such as books & scrolls, livestock, jewelry, armors & armor, and so on.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> If a character has the appropriate skill covering the item he’s looking to
                sell/purchase, he can get within her roll, expressed at a percentage, of what the item is currently
                worth, with the Check based on how common the item is and how closely it relates to his skill’s focus.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Additionally, the character should get a bonus if he has any skill that’s
                applicable to the thing he’s purchasing.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ARTISTRY (specific)</strong> While some many
                not find the Fine Arts a worthy way to spend time, others may disagree. Artistry covers all artistic
                endeavors, including painting, sculpture, embroidery and anything else that is done for art’s sake.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COOKING/BAKING</strong> On the road, a hot meal can
                count for a lot. A character who has a hot meal subtracts 1 day off the amount of time it takes to heal
                their Stress per Stress, so, they’re able to heal 15 Stress in 120 days, instead of 105.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> On top of this, a character can prep otherwise unpalatable or poisonous food in such
                a way as to make the most of it, though it is a Challenging check to do so, meaning they can stretch
                rations for longer.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Unless the character is trying to prep a feast worthy of His Imperial
                Majesty, basic daily cooking only requires a Trivial check.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CRAFT (specific)</strong> This skill covers any
                skill that makes something that isn’t noted here, such as carpentry, tailoring, basket weaving, pottery,
                etc.. The GM may adjust the price for a particularly difficult to master study.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LEATHERWORKING</strong> From the moment it
                leaves the beast to the moment the final touches are finished, leatherworking handles the process of
                making and crafting works from the hides of animals, including skinning and tanning. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MAINTAINCE</strong> The skill of tinkers and
                adventurers, this gives the person a general knowledge of easy and ad hoc fixes that can be done on the
                fly. The level of difficulty in repairing something is equal to the total penalty it gives, rounded up
                to the nearest dice size.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So repairing a spear with a -1 to Attack and Damage is Trivial (d4!), while
                repairing one with a -3 to Attack and Damage is Easy (d6!). </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>METALWORKING</strong> This covers the process
                of changing crude ore into a beautiful weapon, armor, or decorative piece. It also covers the
                construction and repair of more mundane things, like plows, but if you’re picking this skill up, I doubt
                you’re doing it to corner the farmer’s market.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MUSICIAN (specific)</strong> This covers the mastery of
                specific instrument, including singing. At the end of the day, the dulcet tones of a neatly played
                mandolin can ease the ache of a long day. A character who hears someone play an instrument subtracts 1
                day off the amount of time it takes to heal their Stress per Stress, so, they’re able to heal 15 Stress
                in 10 days, instead of 15.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> This doesn’t stack with others playing, however, and does no good if you’re in a
                stressful situation, like being hunted.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Unless the character is trying to serenade a queen, basic daily ditties
                only require a Trivial check.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PERFORMANCE</strong> This skill covers
                everything from making your case before a court or a stirring speech before charging into battle. On a
                success, anyone listening gains a temporary d4 Devotion to what the performer wants: whether that’s
                themselves or an organization or a case. If the Devotion already exists, the size is temporarily
                increased. Additionally, the Devotion dice size can be increased 1 for every extra level of difficulty
                the orator passes their check by.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PERSUASION</strong> You may think that the truth is
                powerful enough to carry your argument but you can be beat out by a master of deception. Persuasion is
                the skill of rhetoric and formulating the truth in such a way that make it the most convincing.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The level of difficulty to convince someone is how much evidence you can supply to
                back up your arguments. This is opposed by Deception or Persuasion but only if someone is trying to
                actively trying to deceive or convince the same person as you.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Even if you succeed, this isn’t a permanent way of changing a person’s
                mind. Others may lie more effectively than you can tell the truth and that may cause them to rethink
                their opinion on what you tried to sell them. </p>

            <h5>Social</h5>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Your character is a multi-faceted representation of a fictional persona. She has her
                hopes and her dreams, her strengths and her weakness. All of these add up to hopefully make someone that
                has a compelling story of victory over her flaws, or defeat from the same. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> In game play terms, these are represented by 4 characteristics:</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GOALS</strong> represent what your character is trying
                to achieve.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRAITS</strong> represent what sets your character apart
                from other characters.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PASSIONS</strong> represent interests and things that
                get your character’s blood pumping.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DEVOTIONS</strong> represent their relationships, either
                with people, organizations, or otherworldly powers.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FLAWS</strong> are also considered social
                characteristics so they're back!</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These characteristics will be provided dice that will be used in social
                conflicts addressed below and represents how strong it is, with the bigger the dice, the better it is.
            </p>
            <h1>GOALS</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Characters can start with up to 3 Goals, but needs to have at least one at
                all times. They receive Experience and Honor, as well as increasing the other 3 social characteristics,
                as you progress along the path to completing them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> What does you character want? Why can’t they get it? These are the two
                fundamental questions that should be answered for each Goal. </p>

                            both be the same thing so that you always get to roll them at the same time. However,
                            consider that you’re putting your eggs in one basket and it would be worth it to vary it a
                            little to cover more bases, allowing you to use them more often and perhaps leveraging
                            characteristics to bring in others.</p>

                campaign. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> These goals can be anything from the incorporeal (“I want to find a home” or “I want
                to deal with this anger inside me”) to the very concrete (“I want to find my father’s sword” or “I want
                to stop this invasion”).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The best goals are those that are measurable and obtainable.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Being motivated by a Goal allows you to push yourself beyond what you
                thought was possible. When a Goal applies to a Conflict, you lower the dice size of any Reprecussion
                Dice by 1.</p>

                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> It’s perfectly acceptable to leave your Goals, Traits,

            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Traits are things that stick out about your character. Things that people tend to
                notice about them or that the character defines his identity by. These can be something specific (“I
                have blonde hair”) or something general (“I have an intimidating demeanor”) or somewhere in between
                (“I’m an orc”).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Traits don’t have to be physical in nature. It could be how your character views
                himself (“I’m confident” or “I’m good at math”). They can also be something about your character that he
                just can’t explain (“I’ve always been good with dogs” or “I can read people easily”).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The sky's the limit when it comes to Traits, so go wild, though they can't
                have exceptions. So, "I'm an angry person" works but "I'm an angry person but I don't let it effect my
                work" doesn't.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> You start off with 6 Traits of varying levels: 3 weak, 2 average, and 1 strong.
                These are represented by dice of varying size. How strong these Traits are depends on your Charisma. So,
                if you have a 13 Charisma, you gain 6 Traits - three at d4, one 3d6, one 3d8, and one at 4d8</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While naturally Charismatic characters come out of the gate with strong
                personalities, as you adventure, your character will also grow and change, gaining and strengthening
                their Traits. This can be done by either increasing your Charisma, which also raises your Traits, or by
                buying Traits up directly.</p>

                        <p style="margin:0px;"> Thinking of Traits on the fly is hard. For new players, there's two ways
                            of handling this: either picture a character from fiction you like or find interesting, and
                            try to describe them. These are their Traits and you can crib off them to start with.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"> Or if you have no idea where to start or are just a risk taker, you can
                            use the Trait Generator, which will give you a random Trait. These Traits may not always
                            make sense but they can often serve as a jumping off point for your imagination.</p>

            <h3>ASSIGNING YOUR TRAIT POINTS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> If you want a little more control over your Traits, their strength and how many,
                instead of just accepting what's on the above chart, you can use your Trait points from Charisma to
                modify your Traits how you will. You start off with 6 Traits of varying levels: 3 weak (1d4 each), 2
                average (3d4 each), and 1 strong (4d4). This is instead of what you would have gotten.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> From there, you buy up your Traits using those points in the same way as if you were
                buying them up with CrP. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can also then go back and further increase them with CrP but only after
                you're done using all your Trait Points.</p>

            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> If you want to increase your Traits further, you can spend CrP to give them a boost.
                This represents your character spending time developing their personality rather than spending time
                learning other things. If you built your character in Basic and are now switching over to Advanced, you
                can refund your Trait buy ups to redo them, but only once. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Weak, Medium, and Strong Traits all cost different amounts to raise. Why? Well, in
                the Basic game, there was a very simple strategy to winning and we wanted to keep things simple so you
                could learn the basics. Now we're giving you the power to try different ways of convincing people so we
                needed to make sure the numbers made sense and that you weren't "wasting" your CrP were it wouldn't
                benefit you, so you'll notice that Weak Traits actually get cheaper the more you buy. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can also buy new Traits for the base Xd4 price. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, for example, if you want to increase a Medium Trait from 2d6 to 2d8, it
                would cost 12 CrP. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Please note that you can't buy a Trait past a d12 </p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">

                        <p style="margin:0px;"> If you’re bringing in a new character to a new campaign, it’s highly
                            probable that you won’t know what the game is going to be about, especially if the GM wants
                            to keep it a secret.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> It’s perfectly acceptable to leave your Goals, Traits,
                            Passions, and/or Devotions blank until you’ve got your feet under you but you should have at
                            least a few Medium term goals and your strongest Trait filled out relating to your
                            character’s personal arch. </p>

            </table>
            <h1>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Your Racial Temperament also tends to come into play fairly regularly during social
                situations. Like a Trait, you can add its dice in an Appeal. But what is the dice size? Well, it's your
                Honor Dice. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, basically, if your Racial Temperament applies, you get your Honor Dice
                that round. Pretty easy, pretty straightforward. </p>
            <h1>PASSIONS</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> What does your character do in their downtime? What’re their hobbies and what do
                they spend their time thinking about? These are their Passions.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You have a number of Passion Points from their Intellect that can be used
                to buy and increase your Passion for a subject. New Passions cost 12 points and start at a strength of
                1. You can then spend 8 points to increase that by 1, but you can do this multiple times. You can also
                spend CrP as well in a like manner.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Once per Conflict, if your Passion applies, you can increase a single dice size a
                number of times equal to that Passions strength. This can be done at any time during a Conflict and you
                don't have to spend all the increases form a Passion at one time. You can do this once for every
                applicable Passion but you can't use multiple Passions on a single dice. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you do spend a point to increase a die you've already rolled, you get to
                roll again, taking the second result, even if it's worse.</p>
            <h1>DEVOTIONS</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> The final aspect are the Devotions that your character has. What relationships does
                he have? What organizations does your character associate with? Is he religious and, if so, is his
                loyalty more to his cult or to his god? How does he feel about that thing?</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Relationships between individuals don’t need to be reciprocal or even
                contemporary. A young fighter may be inspired by a girl who doesn't love him back or by a long dead king
                he greatly admires. These are still viable candidates for his Devotion.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Everyone receives two free Devotions: one to their character’s clan/family and
                another of their choice. Each Devotion comes with a "relationship verb" and the thing itself. So, his
                clan Devotion could be "Hate Clan" or "Have mixed feelings about Clan" or "Loyal to Clan"</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Servant Archetypes gain an additional Devotion which is to their god or cult which
                is assumed to have a positive aspect (love, loyal, faithful to, etc.).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These Devotions start a 2.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Devotions are a more powerful driving force than other Characteristics,
                meaning that, if a Devotion applies, you automatically get 1 point for every point you have in it. So,
                if you approach a blood enemy, trying to convince him to help you, even if you’re being entirely
                reasonable, it’ll be much harder to do so.</p>
            <h3>BUYING NEW AND INCREASING DEVOTIONS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> All new Devotions start at 1 and cost 4 CrP to purchase. From there, you
                can increase their size which costs 6 + (2 * your current Devotion). So, to go from a 2 to a 3 Devotion,
                it'll cost you 10 CrP ( 6 + ( 2 * 2 ) ).</p>
            <h1>FLAWS</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Let's circle back to Flaws because they are considered part of your Social
                Characteristics, after all, they make up who your character is as well. You start with your Flaws giving
                you 1d4! + your current total Stress you have in Social Conflicts should you bring them in. </p>
            <h1>WHEN TO USE THESE RULES</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> These rules may not be appropriate to break out everytime two people talk to each
                other, or even disagree on something. If you think your character can make a compelling argument that
                would convince an NPC to change his ways or give him a discount, don’t bother getting your dice out.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, if the GM thinks that what the player is asking isn’t probable, they
                can turn them away at the door. Sure, it’s possible that the blacksmith with give you that sword for
                free, but is it probable? Absolutely not.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> However, it is probable that he’s at least willing to give you a discount. The other
                person must also see a possible benefit to engaging with you.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> So, if you have a Conflict over a discount, that gives him a window to upsell you if
                you lose the Conflict. That might be worth it to him, while just having him give you the sword for away
                for free results in no Conflict unless the fighter convinces the blacksmith that the town is going to be
                shortly overrun by a goblin horde and that he needs a better weapon to fight them off, perhaps the
                blacksmith would be willing to part with the weapon for free, or maybe, if he's particularly stingy,
                he'd be willing to lend it to him temporarily for free. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And so setting the stage for a Conflict is often helping the NPC see what
                they could possibly get from you should they win.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Another way to start a Conflict is to get a person to act on their Characteristics,
                such as provoking a very aggressive person to attack you, or getting someone who is a softtouch to give
                you money. In that case, you simply state that, based on what you know about the person, they should
                probably act this way. If you're actually correct, you can start a Conflict with them. If you're wrong,
                you lose 1 Honor. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> So, for instance, you know that an NPC is a known liar so you want him to lie to
                make a bold faced lie in front of the king to out him as the enemy. You state something along the lines
                of "You know, I think this guy is just a compulsive liar that he'll try and get away with lying to the
                king". If that's correct, you start the Conflict. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> But let's say that the NPC doesn't have a Trait, Flaw, or Passion that
                related to lying. Turns out, the man has a Passion for manipulation instead. He wasn't lying because he
                was a complusive liar, he was lying for a very specific purpose. In that case, you'd lose 1 Honor. </p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">

                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px;"> There may be other reasons why you feel a Conflict is appropriate. This
                            may be the case of a demon who forces his will on another’s demon or, in a more mundane
                            case, in the case of someone who wants to tell the player a secret but also may not trust
                            them entirely or doubt the wisdom of doing so.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There may also be certain circumstances where one person is
                            forced into a Conflict, most often through magical means, but this is most often done as
                            part of a plot point. More information is found in the Conflict as a Plot Point in Bonfire
                            Advanced.</p>

            </table>
            <h1>STARTING the CONFLICT</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Most commonly, The characters have to decide what’s at stake; this is what they’re
                butting heads about and why they’re willing to put themselves on the line. More importantly, each side
                has to define what they want to happen to the stakes. If the stakes are high, this might change how much
                each side to willing to fight to get what they want or what tactic they’ll use to get it.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> You also have to take into account what the other person is just straight up not
                willing to do. You can't convince a priest to desecrate the altar of his Divine, for instance, or
                someone to give away a family heirloom just because you want it. Additionally, both sides have to see
                some sort of benefit, should they win. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, for instance, a blacksmith and a fighter want to get in a conflict over
                the price of a sword. That’s what’s at stake. The fighter wants it at a discount, the blacksmith wants
                to make a bigger profit.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you're starting the Conflict because you're trying to get someone to act
                on one of their Characteristics, you don't have stakes in the same way. Instead, if you win the
                Conflict, they act on their Characteristic, if they win, they manage to restrain themselves and you
                might lose 1 Honor (plus any additional you may have ponyed up). </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your GM has the right to simply say that an argument wouldn't work against
                someone and simply reject letting you put certain dice into your pool. So, for instance, you wouldn't
                get a Leverage die for having a hostage while having a Conflict with an orc who really doesn't care
                about the hostage's life, or you won't be able to bring in your Trait "I'm a gentle soul" to convince
                the hardened tyrannt's heart by making a heartfelt plea for him to stop skinning all the children. </p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                <tr>

                    </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">The standard Conflict is a winner-take-all affair but that’s not always
                            going to be the case. Sometimes there is room for compromise, such as when you’re haggling
                            or trying to get a raise.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">In this case, the stakes are set at the max each side is willing to give.
                            After that, when a player loses Advantage, they can move their max to be closer to the other
                            side. If you do, you also gain a d8! Leverage dice. </p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If what you want and what they want becomes the same, the
                            Conflict is over with the Honor split equally between the two parties.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">So, for example, a fighter and thief are dividing up the reward. Both
                            willing to get into a Conflict over the shares because it means they both can gain
                            something, the stakes are set at a 30/70 split.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">After a few rounds, the fighter loses Advantage. He says that he’s
                            willing to concede to a 40/60 split, with the thief getting the 40, if he wins.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">Note that if the fighter wins, the thief will get 40% of the reward with
                            the fighter pocketing the rest while if the thief wins, he’ll get 70% while the fighter will
                            only get 30%, so even if he loses, by compromising the thief gets more than the starting
                            30%.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If both get to the point where they’re both aiming for a 50/50
                            split, the Conflict is over and they divide the spoils evenly between them, both Honor and
                            treasure.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h1>PLAYING OUT THE CONFLICT</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px;">The Conflict is done in a series of back and forths called “rounds”, in which each
                person is trying to get the other person to back down. This involves an argument-counterargument
                structure. A round starts when someone puts forth an argument and ends when the other person feels
                they’ve countered it or they’ve had to concede, so a round can be multiple exchanges but is commonly
                only a single back and forth.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The side who didn’t start the Conflict starts with 1 point.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Points come in two flavors: Evidence and Appeals.</p>
            <h3>EVIDENCE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Evidence is facts: things that are true, that both people know are true. These are
                flexes in power: I’m the king and so do you a favor if you do this for me. It can also be things you
                know about the other person, or subjects involved: if you know that a person is caring or has a temper,
                you can use that against them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Evidence gives you 3 points. Evidence is the surest way of convincing your opponent
                but it also tends to be more work: you have to know about your opponent and know their situation.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Generally, this is signalled by placing a finger up in the air or pressing
                it against the table.</p>
            <h3>APPEALS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Appeals are appeals to a person’s emotions, their sense of self, or their Honor.
                Traits often (but not always) used this way. It can sometimes be a jab at someone’s character or an
                insinuation of skill, through bragging about how good of a climber you are or maybe displaying your
                weapon in a threatening manner. It can also be how famous your character is.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Appeals vary in the number of points they get you. When presented against Evidence,
                the Appeal gives you as many points as dice.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">If, however, you meet Appeal with Appeal, then each person rolls the dice assigned to
                it. The person with the highest total gets points equal to the number of dice but sets aside a d6! for
                Repercussions, while the other person gets nothing and sets aside a d8!. This makes this a sound move
                for very charismatic people but it is still risky.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This is signalled by placing the dice in front of you, or holding them up,
                though you’re not obliged to reveal how many or their sizes.</p>

                        <p style="margin:0px;">Each side is responsible for their own points but to make it easier, you
                            can use the E/A method.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Write an E and A on top of each other, and then draw a line
                            between them. When someone presents Evidence, put a tally next to the E. When someone wins a
                            round with an Appeal, note how many dice are added by the A. When you're totaling your
                            points at the end just multiple the tallies next to E by 3 and add that to the sum of the
                            numbers by A. This should allow you to quickly jot things down and keep them straight during
                            the Conflict. </p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Here’s some areas you can use to Appeal to your enemy and what their
                corresponding dice might be: </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HONOR </strong>Your standing can carry you through the
                day, even if your arguments are weak. The character with the highest Honor gets to apply a free use of
                their Honor die to their pool.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FAME </strong>The sad truth is that the more famous you
                are, the more people assume you know what you’re talking about. If your Fame is greater than your
                opponents by 25, add a d4. Increase this die one size for every additional 25 points you have above
                them.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STRESS </strong>When your opponent is overworked and
                they're at maximum whelm, it's much easier to get them to give in. You can redeem a d4! worth of
                Leverage for every Stress penalty your opponent has, however, you don't have to redeem all the d4!s all
                in one round and can spread them out over the course of the Conflict.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EQUIPMENT </strong>It may be the case that equipment can
                sway an argument. Often this is through imitation or torture, but gold can also persuade a hesitant
                sellsword or the right equipment might convince a thief to take on a risky job. A badge of authority may
                also win you some influence.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Equipment used for this purpose gains the character a base d8. Equipment that’s
                substandard or that’s being re-purposed from its original use (a knotted rope used to whip a victim or a
                broken glass bottle used to threaten someone) only nets a d4.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STAT SOCIAL DIE </strong>Having an exceptionally high
                Strength or Dexterity might be relevant to the situation. If that’s the case, add that Abilities Social
                Die to your pool.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>APPLICABLE SKILLS </strong>You may roll an
                additional die for any applicable Advanced skill based on that Skill’s Rank. This chart is also used to
                determine the base size of the Passion dice for that Skill. Take the Rank of that Skill and round up to
                the nearest dice size. So a Rank 5 Skill would net a d6 dice while a Rank 14 Skill would net a d20. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But that is by no means a comprehensive list and plays should be rewarded
                for out-of-the-box thinking. Appeals start at a d4!, but this can vary. For instance, a very skilled
                swordsman with a lot of Advanced Training in his weapon of choice makes a more powerful Appeal than a
                rookie. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can use the same Appeal multiple times during a single Conflict.</p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Characteristic as Evidence vs Appeals</h2>
                    </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There’s no hard rule that can be given of when a Trait qualifies
                            as one over the other, but there are some guidelines.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">Generally, if the person whose Characteristic is being used is not
                            directly involved and they’re known by both parties, it is Evidence.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If, however, one of the people is involved in the argument,
                            especially if it is defense, or you’re trying to bring in the Characteristic of someone that
                            the other person doesn’t know, then it is considered an Appeal. </p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The GM can say no to a proposal if the counter argument doesn’t directly
                relate to the argument, so careful phrasing could limit what your opponent can do. This is usually the
                indication that the round isn’t finished yet and the person who was rebuffed can try a different tact or
                argument.</p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Bluffing, or in other words, Lying</h2>
                    </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">As per normal, a character only needs to roll a Deception Check if the
                            other person is suspicious of them, but even then, if one side accuses the other of
                            something, trying to get them to reveal a secret, they can use Deception to try and bluff,
                            hiding their actual reaction.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the person is, in fact, telling the truth but someone is
                            still suspicious of them, they’d roll a Persuasion Check to convince their accuser of their
                            sincerity.</p>
                    </td>

            </table>
            <h3>FAST TALKING </h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">There may be times when you don’t want to/can’t get into a protracted argument and
                just want to overwhelm your opponent into agreeing with you. For example, you need to fast talk your way
                past a guard or convince a henchmen to go first down a trap filled corridor before he remembers he
                doesn’t have insurance.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In those cases, you want to fast talk the person.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">This is, essentially, a Conflict in a single round: either by showing a blatant,
                time-sensitive, piece of Evidence (“Let me in! The orcs are RIGHT THERE”) or by making an Appeal that
                stuns the person with your Charisma.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the person can’t match you or beat you, you won them over: for the next
                30 minutes or so and then they’ll come calling.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Fast Talking is not a way to permanently get a person on your side - it is a
                band-aid tactic to buy you a little extra time.</p>
            <h3>ENDING THE ROUND</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Like I said, a round ends when an argument is countered or conceded.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Countering an argument means that both sides could gain points: if they both put
                forward Evidence, they both get 3 points, if one side puts forward an Appeal against Evidence, that side
                gets points equal to that Appeal’s dice and the other gets 3 points, and so on.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If one side conceded, that means they don’t really have anything to counter
                it and so they get no points and the other gets whatever they put forward.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These points are kept secret until the end of the Conflict.</p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Multiple People in a Conflict</h2>
                    </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can, of course, have people help out in a variety of support
                            roles during a Conflict but they can often trip over each other, giving the opposition a
                            chance to rebuttal.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">While making an Appeal, everyone rolls separately, totalling their
                            results. If this beats the opposition, however, they only gain points equal to the person
                            that rolled the least amount of dice.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">So, if you have 3 people, who roll 7, 5, and 1 dice, and they beat the
                            opposition, they only get 1 point.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The opposition also adds one instance of their Charisma Social
                            dice for each person opposing them.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">If, however, the company is presenting Evidence, it pretty much works the
                            same, however, if multiple players present multiple pieces of Evidence, the opposition is
                            only obliged to counter one of them to get points and the company only gets the points for
                            one Evidence.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">So, if one of the players points out that the person was found at the
                            scene of the crime with the bloody dagger in his hands (a point that the opposition has no
                            counter for) and the other says that the person was also said that the person’s albi was
                            disapproved by an associate that ratted him out, the opposition only needs to reply that his
                            associate was clearly lying to get a more forgiving sentence (which is technically a half
                            truth). </p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Both sides would only get 3 points from that exchange.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Players may take sidebars, of course, (See the Taking a Break
                            Sidebar below) but they may also use the Warfare Advanced Skill to temporarily pause and
                            discuss with each other.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you’re facing multiple people, not that any Evidence has to
                            apply to everyone on the opposition to be effective, thus making Evidence less and less
                            helpful in a situation where you have to convince a group or mob. </p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h3>TRUMP CARDS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">There are some arguments that are so good that they can counter multiple points.
                These are considered trump cards and should be played carefully because they can only counter arguments
                that your opponent has put forward.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Trump cards give a number of points equal to their base times the number of points
                they counter. So, if you put forward Evidence that counters 3 arguments, it would give you 9 points,
                while having a 4 dice Appeal that counts the same number gives you 12 points.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">It doesn’t matter if the arguments have already been counter, in fact,
                that’s when you get the most benefit out of trump cards.</p>
            <h3>ESCALATING A CONFLICT</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A debate between friends is on a different level than two enemies
                mudslinging or threatening to cut each other’s throat if the other doesn’t listen. This is represented
                by levels of escalation.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At baseline, the Conflict is simply a battle of ideas, with each side having
                no person stake in the matter. It is the default and only inflicts Stress.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">However, one or either side can make it <strong
                    class='orangeHeader'>PERSONAL</strong>, which means pride and personal image is starting to get in
                the way. This happens when one side uses more than 3 Appeals in a Conflict or when one side purposely
                makes an insulting comment.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">When a Conflict becomes Personal, Appeals become more powerful, being worth 1 extra
                point on a success, however, people often dig their heels into the ground when you start questioning
                their character, making others things more dangerous.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">The first is that you need to not just beat your opponent, but beat his total points
                by 5 plus a roll of his Honor Dice (which represents his mood).</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But, it can be to your benefit: the winner gains Honor equal to how much he
                beat his opponent by, while the loser loses that much.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Above Personal Conflicts are <strong class='orangeHeader'>INTIMIDATION</strong>
                Conflicts. This means that you’re now threatening personal harm to either the person, or someone the
                person cares about. You can now bring in that shiny blade or talk about what a shame it would be if that
                person’s house burned down.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">This is similar to a Personal Conflict, except that, if you lose and you don’t then
                escalate to violence and follow through on your threats, you lose face, losing 5 Honor.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But, if you escalate to violence and also get your buttkicked, you lose 10
                Honor so if you’re going to start threatening people, make sure you either win or that you’re as tough
                as you say you are.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can jump up levels, going from a standard Conflict to intimidating them
                in a single round, however, you can’t de-escalate.</p>
            <h3>PUSHING THE POINT</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">When one side feels they may have the upperhand and that the other has run out of
                arguments, they can try to push the point, or end the Conflict. He simply tries to push the other side
                to make a decision.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If it turns out that the other person does still have more to say, the
                Conflict continues and the person who was pushed but gave no ground gains 1 point.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If, however, it turns out that the pushed person does, in fact, have no more
                to say, than the Conflict ends</p>
            <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                <tr>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p style="margin:0px;">It may take days or weeks to sway someone, making sure you know them,
                            their likes and dislikes, and that you’ve got all your bases covered.</p>
                        <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In this way, it is perfectly acceptable, should it make sense,
                            that you suspend the Conflict, possibly indefinitely.</p>

            </table>
            <h3>FOLDING</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Folding is what happens when you want to try and give them a lie or are not planning
                on doing what the winner wants. In this case, you give in early.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">If your opponent pushes, you can choose to Fold by saying that you have no more
                arguments, but if the other person suspects that you’re Folding they can try and call you on it, in
                which case it's an opposed Deception Check if you are and a Persuasion Check if you’re not.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Persuasion Check is to make it harder to meta-game whether or not you're
                bluffing.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">If you are Folding and you fail the Deception check, the Conflict continues.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that obviously your accuser now knows you were lying but that doesn’t
                give them a way to prove to other people that was the case. It’s communicated to them with a definite
                drop in the voice or the way you looked away.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">If you’re Folding and succeed at your Deception Check, or if you weren’t and you fail
                on your Persuasion, the accuser pushes the issue but there’s no proof and so he loses face.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The accuser gives you all the Honor he would have gotten from the win and
                only gains it back if he can prove publicly that you were lying.</p>
            <h1>ENDING THE CONFLICT</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px;">At the end of the Conflict, both sides reveal their points. The one with the most
                points gets their way.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Conflicts are stressful for both sides and so everyone in the Conflict gains
                Stress equal to the difference in the point totals.</p>
            <h1>REPERCUSSIONS OF A CONFLICT</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px;">Anyone with dice set aside from using an Appeal now rolls them. Total the results.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;">If the total is less than or equal to 8, the character suffers only a short term
                effect and takes that total in Stress from the encounter.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the total is greater than that, the character gains that total in Stress
                and suffers a long term effect. Choose one of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce the dice size of one of their Traits, Passions, Devotions by 1</li>
                <li>Lose a dice from one of their Traits</li>
                <li>Lose a Trait, Passion, or Devotion</li>
                <li>Change a Goal</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you rolled any 1s, the character is also changed for the better. It
                doesn’t matter how many 1s you roll, you only choose one of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gain a Passion, Devotion, or Trait at d4</li>
                <li>Change a Goal</li>
                <li>Add a dice to one of their Traits</li>
                <li>Receive a temporary d8 to your next conflict</li>
                <li>Increase the dice size of 1 of their Characteristics by 1 for each time you rolled a 1 on your
                    Stress Dice, up to the number of dice associated with that Characteristic and up to a d12!.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Combat</h5>
            <h1>STARTING a COMBAT</h1>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Combat engages as soon as both sides are within eyesight and both know they
                the other intends harm.</p>
            <h3>The CLOCK</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Clock begins at 1, and then progresses to 2, 3, 4 etc, ad infinitum.
                When the Clock matches a character’s Initiative, they go. Each of these numbers represent 1 second of
                time passing. What second a character's next action is referred to as their initiative (or "where they
                are on the Clock") </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This can be a difficult when you first start so we recommend that you start
                with only running a two or three enemies until you get the hang off it. We've also provided a tool that
                can help you keep track of the Clock and enemies easier. You can find it <a
                    href="https://combatcounter.dragon-slayer.net/">here</a>.</p>
            <h3>STARTING INITIATIVE & SURPRISE</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each side rolls an initiative die. The lower the die, the more prepared
                they are for the attack, though typically the instigator goes on second 1. Those that know the battle is
                about to start (like being warned by a predetermined sign) use a d4, and the completely surprised
                receive a d20, while everyone else typically falls on a dice between that. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Those whose initiative hasn’t come up are surprised and continue to do what they
                were doing as if nothing is wrong. They can take no other actions: they’re completely unaware of what’s
                going on.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Should someone attack them during this time, they are completely helpless, defending
                on a d8!.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If the surprised person is hit, the pain quickly brings them into the
                reality of the situation and they may act 2 seconds later (or before that if their initiative was the
                next second). </p>
            <h3>ACTIONS</h3>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> Every action takes a certain amount of time. On a character’s Initiative, they
                declare their action and are told how long that action will take. After that time, the action is
                complete.</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"> So, if a character wants to walk across a room, which will take 8 seconds, and his
                Initiative is 5, once the Clock reaches 5, he starts walking and once it reaches 14, he’s gotten the
                other side of the room. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At any point, you may choose to forfeit your action and change your course.
                If, when half way across the room (at second 9), the character sees that his buddy is in trouble, he can
                immediately decide that, no, he’d rather be there, his character stops walking across the room and
                instead heads over to help his friend. </p>
            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Keeping track of this can be tricky for new players unused to the system.
                To help players make the shift, we've created the <a target="_blank"

                    be using your common sense to determine how long things will take, to unify at least one thing,
                    movement rates are given below.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A person may move up 1 movement category or down 2 in a second.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Running can be kept up for 5 Seconds + Endurance Rank. If you continue to Run
                    after that you take d4 damage at the beginning of every 5 Seconds + Endurance Rank period.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Sprinting can be kept up for Endurance Rank - Stress Penalty in Seconds. If
                    continue to Sprint you take d4! damage at the beginning of every Endurance Rank - Stress Penalty
                    period.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> You can push your character as hard as you'd like, continuing to take damage
                    until they die from fatigue but if you take damage from Running or Sprinting and you stop, you can’t
                    Run or Sprint again until you take a breather.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Also, moving from a Run to Sprint, or vice versa, doesn’t reset that
                    count, so don’t think you can skip taking damage by moving from a Sprint to a Run, you cheeky devil.
                </p>

                            <p style="margin:0px;">Until you get the hang out it, it might be difficult to keep track of
                                when exactly things are happening, which is why we've provided the combat strip on the
                                <a target="_blank"
                                    href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SdyiHUEmgYOpuB6sl5ahDY_KcYbvDl8-/view?usp=sharing">Basic
                                    Combat Cheat Sheet</a>, which is that numbered line on the left hand side going 1 to
                                20. </p>
                            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">To use it, take a marker (dice or a penny works just fine)
                                and place it on your initiative. When that number comes up on the Clock, you do your
                                action and then add the seconds until your next action, looping back around to 0, if
                                needed. </p>
                            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if you attack on second 17 with a weapon with a recovery
                                of 8, place a marker on 17. When the Clock gets to second 17, you attack, and then move
                                the marker to 3 ( since 17 + 8 is above 20, you substract 20 from it). </p>
                            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You may also find it useful to place markers for another
                                things you want to track, like movement and shooting for ranged fighters or when spells
                                will go off or end. </p>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <h3>IMPROVISED WEAPONS</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;">It is entirely possible that you’ll find yourself unarmed and must defend
                    yourself with a chair leg or broken bottle. In these cases, treat is as a club but penalize it for 3
                    seconds and drop its Parry to 0 for not being balanced properly.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Now, it’s also possible that you have superhuman strength and so you can rip a
                    door off its hinges and start bashing people with want and abandon. In this case, it’s entirely
                    possible to do more than a zweihander in sheer concussive force, however, you’ll find that because a
                    door (or similar) isn’t properly weighted or balanced, you’ll find yourself taking a long time to
                    swing and unable to defend yourself properly. In extreme cases like these, the GM can give you a
                    Defense Modifier of somewhere around -8 and the Recovery should never be quicker than 20 seconds.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">On top of this, these wide swings make an otherwise threatening object
                    easy to dodge and so less of a danger, meaning you may still be counted as unarmed while trying to
                    use it.</p>
                <h3>WEAPON STYLES</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The way your character wields a weapon can tell a lot about their priorities in a
                    combat and a weapon can be versatile in the extreme if some thought is put into how its held.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>1 HANDED WEAPON WITH SHIELD </strong>This is the
                    standard way your character is assumed to be wielding their weapon.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>1 HANDED WEAPON WITH FREE SECOND HAND </strong>With
                    one hand free, the character can focus a bit more on their defense and seizing openings. They gain a
                    +2 to their Parry and -1 to their Recovery.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>2 1 HANDED WEAPONS (without Ambidextrous Mastery)
                    </strong>If attacking with both, your primary hand attacks with a d12! while your secondary attacks
                    with a d8!. You only receive your main hand’s Parry, if any. The secondary attacks slightly slower;
                    always attacking a number of seconds equal to its Recovery after the primary makes its attacks.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">When defending with one hand, you defend against the first attack against you
                    with a d20!, using the Parry value of the off-hand weapon.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">You can only switch Tactics on your primary attack.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">If the weapon off-hand weapon is as large as you, you can only attack with it.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>2 1 HANDED WEAPONS (with Ambidextrous Mastery)
                    </strong>f attacking with both, both attack with a d20!. You only receive your main hand’s Parry, if
                    any. The secondary attacks slightly slower; always attacking a number of seconds equal to its
                    Recovery after the primary makes its attacks. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">When defending with one, you defend against the first attack against you with a
                    d20!, using the full Parry of one and half the Parry of the other, added together (the combination
                    is your choice).</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">You can only switch Tactics and Weapon Styles on your primary attack. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">If the weapon off-hand is as large as you, you can only attack with it. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>2 HANDING 1 HANDED WEAPONS </strong>Using two hands
                    where one is sufficient allows you to leverage more of your strength and deal a harsher blow but
                    slows you down.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">When using this style, you increase your damage by +4, however, you swap out the
                    bonuses for a +3 to Recovery. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">This style can’t be effectively used in combat on weapons smaller than your size.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DOUBLE SHIELDS </strong>While it gives no offensive
                    benefit, the double shields style allows you to cover more facings to gain a greater defense. If two
                    shields have overlapping faces, use the higher of the two's Parry.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>WEAPON IN YOUR OFF HAND </strong>This may come about
                    because your main hand is disabled or you just want to show off. But this implies the main hand is
                    free. If not, see the 2 1 Handed Weapons style. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Non-Ambidextrous people attack with a d12! And gain a +5 Recovery penalty to
                    off-handed attacks.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>2 HANDS FREE (NO WEAPON) </strong>If you have no
                    weapons in combat, you’re not really seen as a threat and so an attacker doesn’t really have to do
                    the dance to try to avoid you blows while trying to strike you.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In this style, your opponent attacks at half their weapon Recovery and
                    they get a free attack whenever you try and close in an attack them. That includes moving ranges.

                                one so you may decide to drop your weapon to try and grapple your opponent easier. If
                                the unarmed attack is on the same second that you drop your weapon, your opponent
                                doesn’t receive the free attack on you.</p>

                <h1>The COMBAT</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> It is inevitable that if you get into combat, you’ll end up engaged in
                    a melee with your enemy.</p>
                <h3>ZONES of ENGAGEMENT: MEASURING YOUR OPPONENT</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are 3 positions that you can have relative to your enemy. These
                    positions aren’t reciprocal by nature: you can be threatened by someone and not have them be
                    threatened by you.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NOT ENGAGED</strong> This is basically the default.
                    You are too far away for them to reasonable do anything.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>THREATENED</strong> This means that you’re within 5
                    feet + your opponent’s weapon’s measure. From here, if you move faster than a Jog and if they’re
                    within half their weapon Recovery, they can attack you. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> If you go from Engaged to Threatened, your weapon initiative doesn't reset, so
                    if you become Engaged again for any reason before your weapon's Recovery, you may not attack. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ENGAGED</strong> You’ve closed the distance
                    and can actually make an attack. The person with the highest weapon measure attacks first. If both
                    weapons are exactly the same measure, the attacks happen simultaneously.</p>
                <h3>MELEE ATTACK & DEFENSE</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Basic melee attacks always roll a base d20! + any attack modifiers,
                    while defenders either rolls a d20! + any defense modifiers</p>
                <h3>PERFECT ATTACKS & DEFENSES</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;">A Perfect Attack or Defense is one that puts you in a better position to win. A
                    Perfect Attack occurs on an unmodified roll of 20 on your Attack roll, while a Perfect Defense is an
                    unmodified 20 on your Defense roll, but only if your final totals are still greater than you
                    opponent’s. If not, the attack still hits for Perfect Attacks and you still dodge the blow for
                    Perfect Defenses but you don’t gain the auxiliary benefits.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If both those qualifiers are met you gain the following benefits on top
                    of the normal ones:</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PERFECT ATTACK </strong>You gain a free
                    automatically successful Unarmed Combat attack. If you have Masteries in Unarmed Combat, you may
                    roll for the additional benefit, but even on a failure, you gain the move’s base benefit.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">You may also Shift with no penalty and change your Tactic.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">If you’re firing a ranged weapon, you don’t receive the Unarmed attack, however
                    you managed to hit a sensitive area, lowering their max movement speed by one category, minimum
                    Crawl speed.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PERFECT DEFENSE </strong>You gain a free
                    automatically successful Unarmed Combat attack. If you have Masteries in Unarmed Combat, you may
                    roll for the additional benefit, but even on a failure, you gain the move’s benefit.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">You may also Shift with no penalty and change your Tactic. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Additionally, you gain a chance to riposte, gaining a free full attack the next
                    second if you’re wielding a melee weapon. This attack doesn’t affect your current count.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NEAR PERFECT ATTACKS AND DEFENCE
                    </strong>An unmodified roll of 19 on either Attack or Defense results in a Near Perfect Attack or
                    Defense, where you may Shift for no penalty, change your Tactic, or, for attacks, gain an extra d4!
                    to damage, or, for defenses gained a free riposte with your off hand weapon if it’s smaller than
                    your size.</p>
                <h3>RANGED ATTACK & DEFENSE</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Ranged attacks and defenses function identical to melee attacks and defenses
                    (including Flanking, btw), only the range also gets factored in.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> But, ranged defenses also get at least 1 other bonus: movement. When
                    defending against a ranged attack, you get a +2 for each Movement Category above standing still. So,
                    if you're getting shot at, get the lead out. </p>
                <h3>COVER</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Cover is anything that gets between you and the person trying to shoot
                    at you.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For solid objects, such as walls, where it is easy to calculate how much
                    of the person is covered, a flat bonus is appropriate. For every 10% covered, you get a +2, so 25%
                    would be a +5, 50% would be a +10 and so on.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">For people, tree, a moving object, or really anything that’s harder to calculate,
                    you’ll use a dice backed on the difference in size, starting at a d20. Each difference in size
                    shrinks or increases that cover die by 1 size. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Cover dice for most objects works the same as shields - if you’re behind
                    cover, you add a roll of that dice to your defense. If you’re actively crouching behind it, you add
                    the max it would give you to your defense plus another roll of the dice.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">So, two medium size people standing one in front of the other would give the guy
                    in the back d20 cover, same as two small sized people. If the person in the front is small sized and
                    the guy in the back is still medium sized, the guy in the back only gains a d12 cover.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the person is actively moving or trying not to be your cover, you
                    can’t gain the bonus for actively crouching behind them.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">If you don't move, however, cover becomes more and more useless as your shooter
                    sights in. For each shot against you where you haven't moved, you either lower your effective cover
                    percentage by 10 or shrink your cover dice by 1 size, depending on whether the cover is static or
                    not. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note this also applies to shields as well, so if you don't move while
                    using a shield, it becomes less effective. </p>
                <h3>RANGED MISSES</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;">On a miss with a ranged weapon, the missile doesn’t magically disappear into
                    oblivion. There’s a good chance it might hit someone else, especially if your target is locked in
                    melee.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">In the case of a miss, roll a d20! and a d4. The d4 determines to which side the
                    missile strays - an odd result means it goes left, an even result means it goes right.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The d20! determines how many feet it strays from the target. Draw an
                    imaginary line between the archer and that point. Everyone within 5ft of that line needs to roll a
                    defense vs the original attack roll, starting with the person closest to the archer and ending with
                    the furthest possible target.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Inanimate objects may provide enough cover to be considered targets in
                    both Firing into Combat and Ranged Misses, such as a large boulder or tree. In which case, medium
                    sized objects roll a d12!, with each size lower decreasing the dice size by 2, and each size larger
                    increasing the dice size by 2.</p>
                <h3>FIRING INTO MELEE</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;">If there’s any one within 5 ft of a direct line between the origin of the missile
                    and the target, they’ll have to roll the appropriate defense die vs the original attack roll to see
                    if the missile hits them instead, starting with the person closest to the archer or gunner and
                    ending with the intended target.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">All the normal rolls apply so if the missile only misses because of
                    cover, the missile has lodged itself in the cover and goes no further.</p>
                <h3>DEALING DAMAGE</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Once both sides have rolled and added all modifiers, compare the totals against
                    each other.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If the defender’s is equal to or greater than the attacker, the attack
                    misses.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PARRYING</strong> If the attack roll is within the
                    Parry Threshold of the defender’s total, the defender may choose to deflect some of the incoming
                    attack.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> The attacker rolls their damage and subtracts the shield or weapon’s DR and then
                    their armor’s DR. Any left over is still done to the defender. For piercing weapons, the /d DR of
                    the shield or weapon is tripled. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, a defender with a Parry Threshold of 4, and a total of 10 for their
                    defense roll vs an attack roll of 14, could choose to parry the blow, taking less damage.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> However, if it’s not, the attack lands and the attacker rolls his
                    weapon’s damage die and adds any appropriate damage modifiers. The defender than subtracts their
                    Damage Reduction and the remaining total is subtracted from their Vitality and added to their list
                    of wounds.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DAMAGE REDUCTION</strong> Armor and one Mastery
                    allows you to reduce the amount of damage taken. This is often times shorted to DR. There are two
                    types: Static, noted by just a number, and Per Die, noted by a number /D.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Static simply subtracts that number from the damage and is done.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> /D subtracts that number multiplied by the number of dice the attack is
                    using. So, if someone is attacking you with a slashing weapon (2d6!), and you have armor that gives
                    you 4/D, you’d subtract 8 from the damage. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Either way, if the attacker chooses to remain in engaged, he then adds
                    his weapon’s Recovery to the current second on the Clock. Once the Clock reaches that new number, he
                    may attack again. </p>
                <h3>KNOCK-BACKS</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the pre-DR damage is higher than your enemy’s Vitality Size Modifier
                    + 3 for every level of Encumbrance you have, the attack also moves them back 5 feet. If it’s twice
                    the damage needed, they get knocked back 10 feet, and so on.</p>
                <h3>VITALITY & DAMAGE</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Remember that if you drop a Vitality Category you gain Stress equal to
                    your Encumbrance</p>
                <h3>TRAUMA</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> If someone does enough damage in one hit for you to skip a Wound Category (25%
                    of their Vitality), you’ll have to roll a Trauma check, which is a Con check.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Failure means that your character has been overcome with pain to the
                    point that he’s unable to act, leaving him completely defenseless for a number of seconds equal to
                    how much he failed by times 3.</p>
                <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                    <tr>
                        <th>
                            <h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Double & Triple Trauma</h2>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <p style="margin:0px;">A character that gets dealt 2 Wound Categories worth of damage in a
                                single blow has suffered a grievous wound - the scar of which, if he survives, will be
                                with him until the day he dies.</p>
                            <p style="margin:0px;">When this happens, the character rolls a 1d20. On any result other
                                than 1 or 20, the character increases the number of scars they have by 1. On a 20,
                                increase that number by 2.</p>
                            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But on a 1, the character has suffered such great trauma,
                                that they gain a new Physical Flaw rolled randomly. They gain no CrP for it.</p>
                            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Battle scars are marks of pride and honor. Characters who
                                become scared gain a d4 Trait “Battle Scars”. When their number of scars increases to
                                more than the max value of that dice, increase that Trait by 1 dice size. So, a person
                                who gains his 5th scar increases “Battle Scars” to a d6 while someone getting their 9th,
                                increases it from a d8 to a d10.</p>
                            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Should the character suffer 3 Wound Categories worth of
                                damage, the trauma is too much and they simply die where they stand if they fail their
                                check. Even if they succeed, they’re still suffer Trauma for the next 30 seconds. </p>
                        </td>

                <h3>GRIT</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> There are times when you have to reach deep down inside and find the hero
                    within. Pushing through the pain to line up that perfect shot. This is what it means to have Grit.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> You may spend Vitality to increase or decrease any dice roll on a 1 for 1 with
                    it all going on 1 wound. The following are exceptions:</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The first Vitality spent also zero outs any Stress Penalties, so
                    spending 1 Vitality while Bloodied, gives you a net +1. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Only one person may use Grit at a time. If two people declare they’re
                    using Grit, it goes to the person in the Vitality Category closest to Bleeding Out. Ties go to the
                    person who declared first. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You may declare your use of Grit after you know the totals of the rolls
                    but before the next roll is made. </p>
                <h3>COUP de GRACE</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A helpless enemy is one completely at your mercy. If a character is
                    completely helpless, either from failing a Trauma check, being bound, or deep asleep, a character
                    can kill the target instantly. This move takes 10 seconds to complete as it takes a bit of
                    positioning to pull off. The character’s who throat is being slit gives out a cry of pain as they
                    expire.</p>
                <h3>FACING & FIGHTING MULTIPLE PEOPLE</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> The likelihood is that at some point you’ll want to be flanking or someone with
                    want to flank you, to try and gain an advantage.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Defending right in front of you is pretty easy and so brooks no penalties,
                    however, every 45 degree off that the defender lowers their Defense dice by 1 size, with those being
                    attacked from directly behind defend on a d8! since they take advantage of a huge blindspot.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This penalty can be mitigated through the use of shields. Small shields
                    allow you to defend against an additional assailant, depriving them of that bonus, while Medium and
                    Large ones allow you to defend against an extra 2 and 3, respectively.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A maximum of 8 people at a time can effectively attack person at once,
                    assuming that they’re out in the open. After that, every assailant’s attack die is lowered by 1 size
                    per extra person.</p>
                <h3>TERRAIN & SITUATIONAL FACTORS</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> No battlefield is absolutely flat and featureless and often these features can
                    make a difference for those cunning enough to use them. This section won’t give you all the
                    different situations you might find yourself in, but should give you a good basis to judge off of.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> The numbers under the Attack and Defense columns are the change penalty or
                    bonus. If there is a dice noted there, you replace your d20! with that when rolling. So, standing in
                    quicksand gives you a -8 to Defense (amongst other things).</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Note that defense penalties also affect ranged defenses.</p>

                <h3>TACTICS</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> These rules add another layer of strategy to combat and should be implemented as
                    soon as you have the basics down.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> A combatant utilizing these moves can only commit to one at a time,
                    unless otherwise stated and can only switch on their attack unless it says otherwise.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ACTIVE DODGING</strong> This move relays on actively
                    focusing on dodging against incoming attacks.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> A defender commits to how much he wants to focus on dodging incoming attacks,
                    both melee and ranged, choosing from a bonus to his defense in the range of +1 to +5, but netting an
                    equal penalty to his attacks (-1 to -5).</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, this lowers the range for Near Perfect Defenses by 1, so you score
                    them on a base natural 18 - 19. This tactic needs to be committed to for at least your full weapon
                    Recovery. After that you may continue using it and change tactics at any point.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> But focusing on defense does slow you down, since you're zigzaging and trying to
                    juke out your enemy, so you're movement is considered 1 Category lower for how far you move. So, if
                    you're Medium sized and Active Dodging while at a Run, you would move at 10 ft / sec, instead of 15.
                    You would still be subject to the damage, however, since you're still technically running. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Active Dodging can be combined with Retreat and Step Back, adding only the
                    attack penalties but gaining all auxiliary benefits from each (so no, the defenses don't stack).</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BRACE YOURSELF</strong> Maybe you look at your
                    opponent and say "No, you move". You root your stance and ready yourself, sacrificing some
                    maneuverability to hold the line and get a better chance of striking first.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> While using this Tactic, a character adds +15 to their Knock-Back Treshold and
                    gains a +1 to their Measure, however, they defend on a d12!. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CALLED SHOT</strong> By carefully aiming your shot,
                    a character can reduce the effects of heavy armor by taking more time to target gaps. When employing
                    this tactic, a character halves their effective number of damage dice (rounded up) for considering
                    /D DR, however, it takes a bit longer to set up the strike and so they increase their Recovery by 3
                    seconds.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Crushing weapons are unable to employ this tactic.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CAREFUL AIMING</strong> By taking a moment or two,
                    you can sight in with any ranged weapon, giving you a better chance to hit your target, however,
                    there are diminishing returns after a bit.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">For the first 3 seconds, you gain an increasing bonus of +1 to hit. So, the first
                    second you’re aiming, you get a +1, the next a +2 (for a total of +3), and the third you get a +3
                    (for a total of +6).</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">After that, that bonus shrinks by 1 each second. So, the fourth second you get a
                    +2 (for a total of +8) and the fifth second you get a +1 (for a total of +9).</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Further delay gives you no bonuses.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CHARGE</strong> A character moving at least a Run
                    can throw their full force behind a blow, knocking their opponent off their guard. If the Attacker
                    has reach, the damage for their next attack is considered doubled for the purposes of determining
                    Knock-Backs, though they defend with a d12! for half their weapon Recovery.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">A charge is a terrifying tactic: should the blow land, they may add a d6!
                    Leverage to their side’s Morale for the rest of the combat.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CHOKING UP ON YOUR WEAPON</strong> When you’ve
                    choked up on your weapon, your weapon’s Measure is halved, and you add that number, rounded down to
                    its Recovery. Your halved Measure is considered your new Measure for determining who attacks first
                    and what Tactics can be employed on you as well.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> However, if an opponent is In Your Guard and you choke up on your weapon, you
                    defend with a standard 1d20! and deal full weapon damage.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> You’re unable to employ this tactic twice if someone again gets within your
                    guard.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FEINT</strong> When performing this move, you
                    (hopefully) get your enemy to commit his guard to a different location than you plan on hitting.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Before you roll, if you declare a Feint, you receive a +5 to that Attack but
                    receive a -3 to Defense until your next attack. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FEND OFF</strong> If your weapon's measure is at
                    least 1 foot greater than your opponent's, you can try and fend them off. This means that you may
                    attack them freely, while they can't do the same to you.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> You may only use this Tactic as someone is going from Threathened to Engaged, in
                    which case they're automatically considered to be Fended Off. To full becoming engaged with you,
                    they'll have to knock your weapon aside with a regular attack that deals no damage. Should they hit,
                    they become fully engaged and can attack freely again. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>IN THEIR GUARD</strong> If you're engaged with a
                    person and have a weapon that is at least 1 foot shorter than your opponent, you may attempt to get
                    in their guard. On a successful attack that deals no damage, the shorter weapon fighter has
                    successfully knocked his foe's weapon aside and is no fighting at extreme close range, cause them
                    huge penalties.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> The longer weapon may only defend with a d12!. All damage dice is also reduced
                    by one size (3d4! → 3d3!). They may, in turn, employ the Choke Up On Your Weapon Tactic.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FLURRY of BLOWS</strong> This tactic involves
                    releasing a rain of quick attacks that rely more on speed than accuracy or power.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> While employing this tactic, you attack 3 seconds quicker, however, you suffer a
                    -3 to Attack, your damage doesn’t explode, and you gain Stress equal to your encumbrance for every
                    20 seconds you keep up your onslaught, though this is all healed if you Take a Breather.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>JAB</strong> A strike that is meant to purposely to
                    open your opponent’s guard and get them off their balance by making them shift their defense.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> The Jab attack happens at half weapon Recovery (rounded up) for Piercing and
                    Slashing weapons. Instead of a d20!, the defender uses a d12! but on a successful hit, no damage is
                    done, and the defender nets a -1 to their next full defense against a non-jab attack. This penalty
                    doubles with each jab, however, it only lasts until the defender’s next full defense.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Crushing weapons may use this tactic but it’s not any faster than their regular
                    Recovery.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LONG GUARD</strong> By placing your weapon further
                    out in front of you and trying to line the body of the weapon with the defender’s eye line, this may
                    allow a person with a short weapon the first strike.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> While using this tactic, you increase your weapon’s measure by 1/2 ft but you
                    reduce your damage’s largest die by 1 size.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Crushing weapons are unable to employ this tactic.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>POWER ATTACK</strong> This is the fighting
                    equivalent of baseball batting your enemy, swinging with all your might.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> With this attack, you receive a -3 to your Attack and next defense but your
                    damage increases</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Piercing weapons increase 1 die by 1 size. Slashing weapons increase all dice by
                    1 size and crushing weapons increase its highest die by 2 sizes.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RETREAT</strong> This is a defensive tactic that
                    involves moving directly back at jog or at a 45 degree angle from your opponent’s blows at a walk.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> After your defense roll, if you declare a Retreat, you receive a +5 to your next
                    Defense roll but also a -5 to your next Attack and must continue to move back until your next
                    attack, either at a jog, if moving directly back, or at a walk, if started to move at a 45 degree
                    angle.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> If your opponent is using the Flurry of Blows, Feint, or the Power Attack
                    tactic, if they do hit, you only receive half damage</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHIFT</strong> You move at your walking speed to
                    either side of your opponent, but suffer a -1 to your next Attack and Defense for every 5 ft you
                    travel before your next Attack or Defense. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> However, if you Shift with another tactic, you don’t receive this penalty and
                    gain a +1 that can be either used to increase a bonus or decrease a penalty from that tactic. You
                    may do this freely with any Tactic except Retreat and Step Back.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Shifting is also used to change Facings so if you’re engaged with an enemy and
                    you Shift. And don’t forget that you get those tasty bonuses from flanking your enemy if they don’t
                    also Shift to face you.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STEP BACK</strong> This is a defensive tactic that
                    involves moving directly back from your opponent’s blows at your walking speed.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Before your defense roll, if you declare a Step Back, you receive a +5 to your
                    next Defense roll but on your next attack roll shrink the damage of your dice based on its type and
                    must continue to move back at a Walking speed until your next attack.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Piercing weapons lower 1 of their dice by 1 size. Slashing lower all dice by 1
                    size and crushing lowers their highest die by 2 sizes.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If your opponent is using the Flurry of Blows, Faint, or the Power
                    Attack tactic, if they do hit, you only receive half damage.</p>
                <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">

                            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> While they may seem similar on the surface, these two
                                different tactics have some key differences I thought I’d point out so that you can
                                utilize each better.</p>
                            <p style="margin:0px;"> 1. Step Back must be declared before you roll your defense while
                                Retreat can be declared after, meaning that if you see you rolled low before employing
                                them.</p>
                            <p style="margin:0px;"> 2. Step Back moves your character straight back, while Retreat
                                allows you to move up to 45° to the left and right, meaning that if you’re going to be
                                backed against a wall, it’s an option to try and skirt your opponent.</p>
                            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> 3. Retreat may be done at a jogging speed, while Step Back
                                is always at a walk.</p>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STRIKE THE WEAPON</strong> This has two purposes: to
                    either knock an opponent's weapon aside to delay their attack or to try and shatter your opponent’s
                    weapon.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> The defender rolls a standard defense die vs the attacker’s regular attack roll.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Should the attack succeed, he delays the defender’s next attack by a number of
                    seconds equal to 1 for every 3 full points he scored above the defender’s total.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> If the difference between the attack and defense was greater than 15, the
                    attacker has a chance of breaking the opponent’s weapon</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The defender’s weapon is treated as a shield using the Shield Breakage
                    rules, with the attacker dealing his damage to the weapon.</p>
                <h3>UNARMED COMBAT</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Unarmed Combat’s primary use is to either disable or control your foe,
                    thus winning the battle by maneuvering, rather than raw damage output.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">To use an unarmed attack, roll an attack on a d10!, adding your normal attack
                    modifiers, but also adding your Damage Modifier. Your opponent rolls a regular defense (including
                    shield unless otherwise stated) but also adds their Damage Modifier as well.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Size does count for something: the larger person, if there is one, gains
                    a +6 for each Size Category they have on their opponent. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">If you hit, you successfully pulled off the move and gain the benefit.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If the difference between the attack and defense totals were more than
                    the target’s Vitality Size Modifier, you may gain additional benefits listed in the move. If the
                    difference is double the Target’s Vitality Size Modifier, they may immediately make a second unarmed
                    combat attack for free the same second.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you’re doing the move or defending with two hands, roll your attack
                    on a d20!.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GRAB </strong>This move is meant to disable or gain
                    control of a limb or item, whether that’s their belt, their leg, or their sword.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The target must be declared before the roll. Attempting to grab a shield means
                    the target subtracts their shield’s unmodified Encumbrance Adjustment from their roll as well since
                    a larger shield is easier to grab. Additionally, attempting to grab most parts of the body involve
                    grabbing armor, if they're wearing any. Add your target's armor's unmodified Encumbrance Adjustment
                    as well as applicable.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The exact bonus will depend on the situation but here are some
                    guidelines:</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Weapon: The defender gets a free attack if the move isn’t successful but when
                    grabbed it means the defender can no longer attack.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Shield: The defender no longer gains any bonus from their shield but still has
                    the defense and Encumbrance penalties. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Arm: See Weapon if it’s the weapon’s arm and Shield if it’s the shield’s arm. The
                    defender also defends on a d12 vs Pushes and can’t change their facing willingly.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Leg: Moving above a crawl is impossible and moving at all can only be done after
                    a successful opposed Str check vs d20! + the grabber’s strength. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The grabber defends with a d8! unless they’re employing something to let
                    them keep their distance (a lasso or mancatch, for example). The grabber only defends with a d8!
                    against Throws/Tackles. Their defense dice is lowered by 1 for all facings.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">A second grab on a non-body part works as a disarm, wrenching the item free
                    unless secured by something strong, though at the very least, the thing is no longer in hand. This
                    is also done on an additional benefit from a well executed move if the attacker wishes.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PUSH </strong>By pushing you opponent in just the
                    right way, you can move them or shift them in the direction you wish.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">On a successful Push, your target changes one facing or moves 5 ft to the left,
                    right, or directly back. You may immediately Shift to follow them without penalty.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">You gain an additional facing change or 5 ft of movement on a well executed Push.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>THROW/TACKLE </strong>This move attempts to throw
                    your opponent to the ground and is easier to pull of if you go prone with them.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">For this move, you can increase the attack dice size by 1 if you’re at running
                    speed when you Tackle them and another if you choose to go to the ground with them, however, if you
                    lose the struggle, you still end up on the ground.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Getting forced to the ground for you opponent resets their Count and reduces
                    their Attack and Defense dies to a d8! if they’re wielding a Medium sized or larger weapon.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The extra bonus for this move is being able to remain standing if you so choose
                    and possibly disarming them if they fail a Str check vs d20! + your Str.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STRIKE </strong>A strike is a punch with any part of
                    your body or shield. It’s not really about doing damage but more about throwing your opponent off.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">On a successful Strike, you delay your opponent’s next attack by 1d4 seconds,
                    though if you’re using a shield to strike, you subtract that shield’s Recovery Mod from that amount,
                    delaying them further. Striking an already stunned opponent is less effective and so the number of
                    second they would be further delayed is lowered by 1 for each time you've successfully struck them
                    since their last attack, down to 0.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The extra bonus for this move is that it increases the time to a d6!.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BREAK FREE </strong>There will probably come a time
                    when you want to break free from a grab, pin, or choke hold.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">This is done through the normal unarmed combat resolution method with the
                    following notes:</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The first is that the defender rolls a d12! while you roll a full d20! as a base.
                    Additionally, the defender adds their Rank in Escape Artist to the check.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The second is that you can only attempt this manuever every 10 seconds,
                    though this is modified by any Advanced Weapon Basic Training you have in unarmed attack.</p>
                <h3>MOUNTED COMBAT</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Whether you're playing a knight or a bounty hunter, you might find it's
                    to your advantage to find yourself something to ride on and you'll probably want to know how you can
                    use that mount in combat, so here are some rules to help you out. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Your mount will have a Turning, Acceleration, and Deceleration stat: this tells
                    you how long, at base, it takes you to turn 180 degrees, speed up 1 Speed Catergory, or slow down 1
                    Speed Category. You declare your intent, wait the few seconds, and, BAM, you've done. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Note, however, that you can't do more than one of these things at a time and once
                    you've committed, you've committed because your mount has its own inertia that it has to deal with
                    and there is a delay between you telling it something and it actually doing it, with the exception
                    of Turning, which can be stopped at any time (so you don't have to always turn your mount 180
                    degrees), but you don't retroactively straighten out your mount to where it was. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">So, for example, if you have a mount with a Turning of 8, that means it turns
                    22.5 degrees per second. If you declare you're turning and then 3 seconds later, you decide,
                    nevermind, you'll still have turned 67.5 degrees. A lot of this should be common sense but I figure
                    it's worth pointing out, just in case. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">That being said, you can lower all of these base times by up to your Riding
                    Skill, however, a mule will probably never be as quick on its hooves as a courser, so you can only
                    lower it to half of what the unmodified value for that derived stat is. So, if your mount's Turning
                    is 8, the lower is can go is 4. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Additionally, for Turning, your mount's Speed Category does prevent it
                    from tunring as quickly as you might like with each Speed Category above a Walk adding 2 Seconds to
                    it. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">So, if you have to think further ahead in combat so that you don't run into
                    anything, what's the point of using a mount? </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">1) because it's awesome and 2) you get a lot of extra bonuses for doing so. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">For starters, if you get that nice +2 to Defense and +d4! to damage if your
                    opponent isn't mounted or on a rock or something, as well as additional damage dice if you're using
                    a weapon specifically meant to be used from horse back (though you get this die even if you're on a
                    camel, lizard, or what-have you). </p>

                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">On top of this, based on the Speed you're moving, you get a bonus to
                    your Defense and bonus to your effective damage when considering Knock Back. Should you gain a
                    successful double Knock Back, your opponent is trampled under hoof, dealing d6! damage and allowing
                    you continue past them. Note that bonuses to Defense are doubled against ranged attacks, which are
                    the values in paranthesis for ease of reference. </p>

                </table>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But, of course, it isn't all good news: moving at higher speeds means
                    that it's harder to hit things, especially in ranged combat. For each Speed Category above
                    Strolling, you lower your Attack Dice by 1 size for melee and 2 sizes for ranged. This can bring you
                    below a d4! and into the negative so lowering 1 size down from a d4! means you roll a d0 and
                    stepping 2 sizes down gives you a -d4! to your attack. A handy table has been provided. Remember
                    that your Riding Skill Rank does off set this, giving you a +1 to your Attack Dice size for each
                    Rank, up to a d20!. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Your mount might also be smarter than you and decide that it really doesn't want
                    to put itself in danger. To get your mount to do something that could cause it damage, you roll a
                    Riding Check + the Mount’s Bravery vs d20! + the amount of damage involved without the mount’s DR
                    factored in. The exception to this is when presented with a crushing or slashing weapon, in which
                    case you half the bonus the enemy d20! gets, rounded down. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, charging into a pike (3d6! Damage) would mean rolling vs a
                    d20!+3d6!, while charging a man brandishing a schiavona would be a d20!+d6! (or 2d3!, either is
                    valid and up to you). Trying to get it to leap a chasm with a 40 ft drop would also cause you to
                    make a roll vs d20!+3d12!. </p>
                <h3>BLEEDING OUT & DYING</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A character falls into the Bleeding Out Wound Category is unconscious
                    and is in danger of dying. This is played out like a Social Conflict, with the person fighting
                    against Death for survival, Appealing to him to let him live.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">However, this has a few changes from a standard Conflict, the first is that each
                    round happens every 5 seconds that the character is in this state. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The second is that you won’t be counting points: it’ll only matter if
                    you win or lose the round. Every time you lose, you bleed out more and take an additional point of
                    damage; every time you win, you get closer to stabilizing.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Getting to half your Constitution in the negative (either from bleeding
                    out or from additional wounds) results in the character's death but getting 10 points means that
                    that stabilize, losing no more Vitality but still remaining unconscious until they're brought back
                    up to Wounded.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Conflict is mainly going to be Appeals, with Death rolling 5d4! to
                    start with. Each successive round the player wins, Death increases the size of his dice. When the
                    player fails a round, Death's dice drop back down to 5d4! again.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Other character's can add their Medicine Skill as an additional dice
                    each round, but not First Aid, though First Aid can bring someone back up to Wounded and just stop
                    the Conflict in its tracks anyway so there's that.</p>

                <p style="margin:0px;">A strong willed or well disciplined person, when faced with insurmountable odds
                    will often fight long after the cowards have run, either gaining victory or assuring his death. This
                    is represented by a character’s Panic Threshold.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">When a person Panics, which correlates to Wound Categories and Honor, they begin
                    to react hastily or unpredictably, allowing them to be more easily persuaded into possibly making a
                    mistake or tactical error.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Check the character’s Honor to determine their starting Panic Threshold.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Record this for your character by circling the Wound Category in your
                    Vitality Section.</p>
                <h3>MORALE CONFLICTS</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Combat is not simply about who can do the most damage the quickest. Battles, at
                    their heart, are manifestations of the fever of conflict going on between the two sides. This is why
                    sometimes a small, untrained force of zealots can overcome a larger professional army.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This is partly represented by Morale, which is a metric for how a given
                    individual is doing, but it’s also represented by a Social Conflict happening during the combat, or
                    a Morale Conflict.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At the beginning of combat, if at least one side has a captain, a
                    Conflict is also started with the two opposing sides are the two opposing forces (the players vs the
                    gobins or the bandits).</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This runs like a normal Conflict except the company captains and in
                    charge and get to dictate pretty much everything. So as the battle progresses, the captains are
                    going to run the Conflict in parallel with it, trying to swing the battlefield to their advantage.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Unlike a regular Conflict, however, it is not about gaining points but about who
                    wins or loses that round. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">During the combat, either captain can, at any time, state that they want
                    a fighter to perform an action or behave in a certain way. For instance, they want him to switch his
                    Tactic to be more aggressive, or swap who he’s aiming for. The only exception is they can’t make
                    them run away (which can happen but we'll talk about that a bit later).</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, for example, you’re the company captain and you’re trying to
                    convince the enemy goblin that he should try and get at your company’s ranger but currently he’s
                    making a beeline for your fighter. In that case, you can use the fighter’s Characteristic “You Don’t
                    Want to Mess With Me” to make an Appeal to get the goblin to second guess himself and go after your
                    ranger.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">If you win that round, the target behaves the way you want. This represents
                    either them being too panicked or not having enough information to make a good decision, or
                    effective leadership and a clear grasp of what’s going on. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A side without a captain can “defend” but can’t go on the attack, so to
                    speak.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can try to convince as many people as you’d like, but remember that,
                    if you use Evidence against them - it has to apply to every person you’re trying to persuade. As
                    such, most of what you’ll be using is Appeals.</p>
                <h3>ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;">On top of that you’ll also have additional places you can pull from for your
                    arguments that only really apply to Morale Conflicts, such as having a seasoned commander,
                    outnumbering the opposing side, having a common Devotion to why they’re fighting and so on.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Here are common things you can draw from:</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>OUTNUMBERING THE ENEMY </strong>Each side can add
                    their total numbers to an Appeal, thus favoring the side with the most people.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CATCHING AN ENEMY BY SURPRISE </strong>This nets you
                    a d8 until their initiative comes up.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>HAVING YOU BATTLE STANDARD UP AND VISIBLE
                    </strong>Nets you a d8.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CAUSING AN ENEMY TO PANIC </strong>Nets you a d6.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CAUSING AN ENEMY TO FLEE </strong>Nets you a d10.
                    This can increase the amount of dice you gain from outnumbering your enemy.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PARTY CAPTAIN’S CHARISMA </strong>You also gain your
                    party captain’s Social Dice from Charisma in this case. Also, any abilities that the Party Captain
                    has that effect Conflicts can also be used during this Conflict.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>A PERFECT ATTACKS & DEFENSE </strong>this
                    nets you a d6! until that person’s next Attack or Defense.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that if the argument is based on circumstance, like having an enemy
                    Panic, it goes away when that circumstance does.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DEVOTIONS </strong>Normally, Devotions
                    would add to your points automatically but since points don’t matter, it would make them useless in
                    Morale Conflicts but, as we all know, why you fight does matter. If a Devotion applies to all the
                    people being targeted that round, they add the lowest level of Devotion to their roll.</p>
                <h3>EFFECTS of MORALE THRESHOLD</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;">While you may target any fighter, remember that those that are Panicked have
                    additional penalties that make them easier targets. Panicked people only gain half the points from
                    Evidence and they half their results from Appeals.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When they become Panicked, they roll any Repercussion Dice they gained
                    so far from Appeals and, should they gain more, they roll those immediately.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">If a person goes above their Stress Threshold, they simply turn and flee, unable
                    to face their own morality. Captains can try and rally them with a Check immediately.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If cornered and given no space to run, these routed fighters enter a
                    frenzy - only using aggressive Tactics and becoming immune to Stress penalties.</p>
                <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">

                            <p style="margin:0px;">It may be the case that the Party Leader, who should be responsible
                                for the Morale Dice Pool is also your main line fighter and is already busy juggling an
                                enemy or two.</p>
                            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can have a player who runs a less combat intense
                                character, such as the magic user or diplomat, be in charge of the Morale Dice Pool in
                                that case and decide where to risk dice, however, only the actual Party Leader’s
                                abilities affect the number or size of those dice applied.</p>

                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Combat ends when one side is incapacitated, reached a truce, or have
                    fled the field. At that point the Clock stops and play moves back to narrative time. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">If you engaged in a Morale Conflict, everyone on the side that won the combat
                    gains the difference in winning pools to their Honor, regardless of whether or not their side has
                    less. So, if the players has 3 in their winning pool and the goblins had 7, every player still gains
                    4 Honor. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The losing side subtracts that with the same caveats. </p>

                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Most things won’t warrant an explanation but some have been provided
                    for further clarification.</p>
                <h1>ENCUMBRANCE</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> You’ve probably noticed that Carry under your Strength Stat is just a string of
                    numbers and letters and you probably wondered: what does that mean? Well, I’m about to tell you.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Instead of each item having a weight in pounds or ounces, each item is assigned
                    a size that represents, not only how much it weighs, but also its general bulky and awkwardness.
                    These sizes correspond to the naming conventions set up in <strong>Chapter 15: Misc Rules</strong>
                    however, just because something is Medium sized here, doesn’t mean it’s the size of a human - again,
                    item sizes are based on their weights, bukliness, and awkwardness to carry.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Your Carry matches up with that, so if you have 2M as your Carry, you
                    can carry 2 Medium items - or 2M items.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">You can also swap out 1 for 3 of the size lower. So instead of carrying 2M items,
                    you could carry 1M item and 3S items.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each individual instance of an item counts towards this: carrying two
                    daggers, both S items, would count as 2S for Encumbrance.</p>
                <h3>WEARING CLOTHES, ARMOR, AND PERSONAL CONTAINERS</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Normally what is written under the Carry column for each item is it’s
                    Encumbrance. The only exception is clothes, armor, and personal containers. If worn on your person,
                    not carried or stuffed in a backpack, these become less encumbering since their weight is
                    distributed across basically the entire body.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">In this case, shrink them 1 size for Carry purposes. Small items become
                    negligible. Wearing boots, a Small item, then makes them effectively weightless, while any Heavy
                    Armor makes them only M.</p>
                <h3>PERSONAL CONTAINERS</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Personal Containers, such as backpacks or sacks, go one step further. Since it is
                    assumed that your Carry weight is how much you can hold effectively, it does take into account that
                    some things are too awkward to effectively carry despite being fairly light.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These containers increase your Carry by the noted amount.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The exceptions, sort of, to this are coin purses, which make coins
                    negligible (otherwise they’re 10 = 1S), quivers which do the same thing but with arrows, and
                    scabbards and sheaths allow you to wear weapons - shrinking them 1 size.</p>
                <h3>GOING OVER CARRY</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can go over your Carry, of course, but each M item worth over your
                    limit increases your Encumbrance by +1, which is fairly forgiving for S and smaller items but not
                    for L and larger items.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Unless proven otherwise, the GM should assume the characters are
                    carrying their max Carry if they pick up something new while out adventuring.</p>
                <h1>CURRENCY</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The denominations of coinage is fairly simple and is done in divisions
                    of 10.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> 10 brass coins (bc) = 1 copper coin (cc)</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> 10 cc = 1 silver coin (sc)</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> 10 sc = 1 gold coin (gc)</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> 10 gc = 1 platinum coin (pc)</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> So, 100 cc is equal to 1 gc.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The silver coin is the base of the economy and is what most day to day
                    interactions use. If a denomination isn’t noted, it’s assumed to be sc.</p>
                <h1>BUYING AT 1st LEVEL</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> A character starts with one of the following kits. After doing so, he rolls the
                    kit's Extra Cash dice to determine any extra starting money to buy additional gear. When buiying new
                    items, use the Source price. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The individual sizes are notes next to the item. Note that anything
                    with * at the end denotes that the item is worn and so the size has been adjusted accordingly.
                    You're also given the sellback price (in sc) in case you don't want the item. For weapons, you'll
                    notice that you're giving a generic size of weapon you can select from - the sellback price is
                    uneffected by which weapon you would have picked up. </p>

                <h1>WAR GEAR</h1>
                <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">It’s generally in poor taste to walk around town or go about your daily business
                    armed like your going to battle. Even nobles don’t make a habit of breaking out their plate when
                    surveying their fief as it signals a general distrust of the smallfolk.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Wearing armor heavier than light, and weapons and armor larger than small while
                    in town or another similarly inappropriate setting docks a person 1 Honor for each infringement at
                    the end of session.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">If they enter a Conflict with someone while they’re clearly being aggressive, the
                    person receives an additional 4d4! per escalation to resist their charms. This applies in the case
                    of an armed man trying to haggle with the shop keeper but not, for instance, in the case of two
                    nobles on the battlefield meeting in the middle to exchange terms and verbal blows with one another.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This penalty can be overcome by simply storing your war equipment on
                    your cart, horse, or arming squire.</p>
                <table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px">
                    <tr>

                            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These rules can really be applied to most situations. A
                                character showing up to a noble’s banquet in rags is going to be just out of place as
                                one in armor, if not more so. Players should be warned if their characters would know
                                they’re walking into a situation where they might earn the derision of others by their
                                attire. </p>
                        </td>

                <h1>SUPERIOR EQUIPEMENT</h1>
                <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Not all equipment is built the same and, if you have some extra coin, it might
                    benefit you to invest in some good quality gear. On the flip side, if you’re strapped for cash, you
                    might save a few silver buying less than optimate gear.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Superior gear is always unique and even two +1 longswords can be different. This
                    is done through Traits and they're like the Traits that your character has: they're used to describe
                    the gear. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">During a Conflict, Combat, or Challenge, if that Trait applies, you can
                    gain an extra d4! to what is going on. This is in additional to the normal d6! Leverage for gear you
                    get in a Conflict and the +d6! you get to your Skill roll in a Challenge. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, for instance, let's say that you get some better armor. You ask to
                    make it extra padded and that becomes it's Trait: Extra Padded. A little while later, you find
                    yourself in combat and you take a particularly nasty blow and you don't want to die and the Trait
                    applies here so you add a temporary d4! to your armor's DR. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This, however, comes at a cost: when used this way in Combat or a Skill
                    Challenge, your gear becomes a little more worn and less impressive, temporarily shrinking that
                    Trait's dice size (down to nothing) until it is mended or repaired. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">You can have additional Traits on a single weapon and increase the power
                    of Traits you already have. Increasing the power simply increases the size of the bonus dice you
                    get, which means you can use it more often between mends and repairs. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Every time you do so adds an extra 50% the cost of the item.</p>

                    that the prices here are not absolute and are actually the lowest price you’ll find for a give item
                    based on the area. War, tariffs, what relationship the buyer has with the seller, and even the
                    political climate can cause these numbers to fluctuate wildly.</p>

                    of the the item in far away markets, either across a political border or beyond a month’s travel
                    away. This price increases the further away the city is, obviously.</p>

                <h3>MOUNT STATS</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Like people, each mount is different though they do have ranges based
                    on the breed and this is represented by their unique set of stats that are rolled for each mount you
                    look at while shopping. These can usually be decerned by a Handle Animal Check that's, of course,
                    appropriate to the type. So, nice try, but Handle Animal (horse) won't help you figuring out which
                    riding lizard is best. Higher stats are always better. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These stats are then used to determine the specifics of each mount: how
                    fast can they get up and go? How long can they run for? Each of the main stats has a positive effect
                    on some of these derived stats and a negative effect on others so figuring out the right balance for
                    what you want out of a mount can be tricky. Averages for each breed is found under that breed's
                    profile in the <a target="_blank" href="https://bestiary.dragon-slayer.net/">Bonfire Bestiary.</a>

                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The details of what these stats mean are expanded on in the Mounted
                    Combat section of <strong>Chapter 10: Combat</strong> but a lower Turning, Deceleration and
                    Acceleration is good, a high Bravery is good, and Endurance, Carry, and Vitality work the same as
                    they do in humans. </p>

                <h1>WEAPON TABLE HEADER EXPLANATION</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Size</strong> A weapon’s size indicates the smallest
                    size the wielder can be to use it 1 handed. Weapons 1 size larger must be wielded with 2 hands and
                    those 2 sizes greater must be wielded with 2 hands and the wielder gains a +3 to their Encumbrance.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Damage</strong> This is the damage inflicted when a
                    successful hit is scored.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Recovery</strong> This is the number of seconds a
                    character locked in melee must wait before attacking again with this weapon.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Dam Type</strong> This tells you whether the weapon is
                    Slashing (S), Piercing (P), or Crushing (C).</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Parry</strong> Some weapons are balanced better than
                    others and that allows you to deflect some blows. This is the weapon’s Parry Threshold. This is
                    overridden by your shield’s Parry if you’re using one. A successful parry with a weapon has a DR of
                    2/D. Parrying with a weapon subjects it to the Shield Breakage rules.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Measure</strong> This is a measure in feet of how long
                    a weapon is. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Bonus</strong> Some weapons have additional
                    unique bonuses. If there is a ‘yes’ in this column, look up the weapon in the following section to
                    find out more details.</p>

                <h1>ARMOR TABLE HEADER EXPLANATION</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>DR</strong> This number is subtracted from the damage
                    dealt by a weapon.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Def</strong> All armor weighs you down and makes it
                    harder to dodge incoming attacks. This number is added to your Defense roll.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Init Mod</strong> Armor is restricting, even at the
                    best of times. This is added to your Initiative roll at the start of combat.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Rec Mod</strong> Again, armor is restricting. This is
                    added to your weapon’s Recovery.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Type</strong> This donates what category your armor
                    falls in. You should note that should you purchase Medium or Heavy armor, this comes with a Gambeson
                    that’s worn underneath for comfort. This is already factored into the other stats of the armor.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Weight</strong> This is how heavy your armor is for
                    encumbrance when your armor is carried on your person. Worn armor doesn’t count towards your
                    encumbrance.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Encumb</strong> This number is added to your
                    Encumbrance as doing things with a weight on you is tiring.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Skill Adj</strong> Armor, regardless of how fitted, is
                    restricting and heavy, making it harder to perform certain skills in certain gear. The first number
                    is what you apply to Str based skills, while the second is how many for Dex based skills.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> In the case of a skill being both Str and Dex based, use the larger of
                    the two numbers.</p>
                <h1>ARMOR BONUSES</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Bone</strong> This armor is especially
                    effective when channelling magic. It only increases your channelling time by 5 if the legs and arms
                    are uncovered and 10 if you wear the gauntlets and boots.</p>
                <h1>SHIELD TABLE HEADER EXPLANATION</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Size</strong> This indicates the general size of a
                    shield. It also determines how tough your shield is.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>DR</strong> This number is subtracted from the damage
                    dealt by a weapon on a successful parry with a shield.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Def</strong> This is the number that you subtract from
                    your character’s defense. Lugging a huge piece of material on the end of your arm makes dodging a
                    bit difficult. Additionally, you’re often moving a shield into harm’s way, meaning, overall, you get
                    hit more while wielding one.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Parry</strong> Some shields are balanced better than
                    others and that allows you to deflect blows more effectively. This number is the shield’s Parry
                    Threshold. This is overrides by your weapon’s Parry. Parrying with a shield subjects it to the
                    Shield Breakage rules.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Cover</strong> This dice is added to your Defense roll
                    against ranged weapons. If you’re actively crouching behind it, you instead add the maximum value of
                    any dice and roll of that dice (i.e., a d8, you add d8 + 8, for d12 + d8, you add d12 + d8 + 20,
                    etc.).</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Flanks</strong> This is the number of additional
                    attackers from the side that the shield can defend against. More on that is found in <strong>Chapter
                        10: Combat</strong></p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Weight</strong> This is how heavy your shield is for
                    encumbrance.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Encumb</strong> This number is added to your
                    Encumbrance as doing things with a weight on you is tiring.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Bonus</strong> Some shields have additional
                    unique bonuses. If there is a ‘yes’ in this column, look up the shield in the following section to
                    find out more details.</p>

                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Buckler</strong> The buckler is a lightweight shield
                    which relies more on parrying blows than outright stopping them. The buckler also has the added
                    benefit of being rather small with almost no weight, allowing it to be worn but not used while
                    wielding two handed weapons. You receive no bonuses when doing this but it means that if you do
                    switch over to a one handed weapon, you instantly get the buckler’s bonus.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Figure Eight</strong> This shield is designed
                    specifically for phalanx or shield wall tactics. This gives a +2 Parry and a Cover of d4 to anyone
                    fighting on either side of you. This stacks with any Parry or Cover that they have from either their
                    weapon or shields.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Pavise</strong> This shield is less a shield and more
                    portable cover employed by gunners and crossbowman, rather than fighters.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> However, the Pavise can be set up using a kick stand in the back, giving anyone
                    crouching behind it basically complete cover and allowing that person the ability to steady their
                    weapon on it.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='greyHeader'>Round</strong> This shield was meant for
                    hitting your opponent, trying to throw them off guard. On a natural roll of 20 on Defense or an
                    Unarmed Strike, you delay your opponent’s next attack by 5 seconds.</p>
                <h5>The Weird</h5>
                <h1>WHAT IS WEIRD?</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Seems like a reasonable place to start. It is called a lot of things by different
                    cultures: mana, magic, juju, but essentially, it’s the metaphysical power that allows people to
                    reshape reality, which is why working with it is often called weirdshaping, or simply shaping, if
                    you don’t want to sound pretentious.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Weird lies beneath the surface of all things, a hidden power that imbues
                    life with those indescribable feelings. It is the reason you feel attracted to someone at first
                    sight, are speechless when you see a beautiful view, or the reason why planets have healing
                    properties. It is not that some things are inherently ‘magical’ or ‘non-magical’ - all things have
                    weird that is waiting to be shaped.</p>
                <h1>ANATOMY OF A SPELL</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">When you shape the weird, it manifests in the Middle Realm as a spell,
                    which is broken up into different parts or “Rudiments”, which are split into types. More details on
                    the specifics is found under the Acquiring Rudiments section below but here’s a brief overview:</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHAPE </strong>This is the shape that the spell
                    shows up in. This can be a circle, cone, or wall, for example.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RANGE </strong>This depends on the Shape of the
                    spell but generally it’s the reach of the spell: how long is the cone or how far can you launch a
                    salvo shaped spell.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ORIGIN </strong>This is where the spell comes into
                    being: this can start as the caster and emanate out, it can imminent from his touch, or it can
                    manifest yards away from him.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EFFECT </strong>This is where the spell usually gets
                    its name and it’s what it actually does. A spell can cause Stress, remove friction, change
                    appearances, and so on. Effects will also list the Interval, which will talk about next, and the
                    base Range for that spell.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Effects are also special because you can add multiple Effects (or even
                    the same effect multiple times, thus making it more powerful) to the same spell but increasing the
                    Drain in the same amount. If it isn’t clear how an Effect would work if Stacked with itself, there’s
                    a Stacking section for each Effect that should clear things up.</p>
                <h3>SHAPING A SPELL</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Each of a spell’s Rudiments will have a Drain value, which added
                    together, is how much that spell costs to cast. A spell must have at least 1 of each Rudiment type.
                </p>
                <h3>FALLOUT</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Bending reality and shaping primordial force is not an easy thing to do
                    and nature doesn’t like it. When you first cast a spell, you take Stress equal to your Encumbrance.
                </p>
                <h1>WEIRD TRADITIONS</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Ways of shaping the Weird are split up into different “Traditions”,
                    which with their own bent on ways the Weird can manifest. These are:</p>
                <h3>ANIMISM </h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on the manipulation of the body, forcing it to
                    endure beyond its normal limits and making it into a weapon.</p>
                <h3>CALLING </h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on the Realms beyond the Middle one we’re so fond
                    of. It involves the summoning of demons, elementals, and spirits.</p>
                <h3>CHARM </h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This focuses on the manifestation of the Weird in its raw and primal
                    form. This allows the Weird to interact with our world in a more physical way.</p>
                <h3>GLAMOUR</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on the manipulation of the senses, tricking the
                    brain into seeing what the caster wants you to see.</p>
                <h3>INVESTITURE </h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This focuses on inanimate objects and either imbuing them with power or
                    manifesting the latent potential that is already in them.</p>
                <h3>OCCULTISM </h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on the hidden world and opening of the third
                    mind: the divination of knowledge and the unseen.</p>
                <h3>SORTILEGE </h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This Tradition focuses on fate, chance, and probability: more
                    specifically, it focuses on messing with it so that things go in your favor.</p>
                <h1>ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO CAST</h1>
                <p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p>
                <h3>SIMULCASTING</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If you have enough SP, you may cast more than one spell in the same
                    second, however you gain 1 Stress for each additional spell cast this way.</p>
                <h3>CONCERT CASTING</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;">For Wild Magic-Users, it is possible to unite your spirits and channel together,
                    thus improving your channelling overall.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">When Concert Casting, there is a ‘lead’ Magic User who casts the spell. Each
                    person added either their channelling dice reduced by 1 size for each additional person (down to a
                    d4!) who’s also adding dice or reduces the channelling time, though it takes 1 person to reduce it
                    by 1 second, 2 additional people for the next second (so 3 total), and so on.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">To effectively Concert Cast, all Magic Users must remain linked through physical
                    contact, though not all of them need to touch the lead Magic User you must be able to be able to
                    trace from that channeller to the lead, but beyond that, they must have some connection with each
                    other. Each channeller needs to have a Devotion to the lead Magic User or the casting will simply
                    not work.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The lead Magic User takes all the SP from the other and uses it to cast
                    his spell, though he’s still affected by his SP limit and may gain Stress because of it.</p>
                <h1>ACQUIRING RUDIMENTS</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px;">At 1st level and as dedicated by your Archetypes, you’ll have the opportunity to
                    acquire new Rudiments, which you can then use to shape spells. You’ll do so by picking a Rudiment
                    table and then rolling on it. If you roll a Rudiment you already have, you may select the Rudiment
                    on either side of it. For Effects, you roll on the Effects By Tradition table and then go to the
                    corresponding subtable. You may spend a CrP to reroll as per the norm, even during level up.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Players that seek out the knowledge to gain a specific Rudiment during
                    play can forgo this roll and simply gain that Rudiment, however, they can’t learn more Rudiments
                    than their Archetype and level dictates.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">At first level, it is required that you have at least 1 Rudiment from
                    each type (so, 1 Shape Rudiment, 1 Origin Rudiment, and so on) but once that’s satisfied they can go
                    back.</p>

                <h3>TEACHING YOUR SPELLS TO OTHERS</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Magic spells are complex things with more layers than an onion, so it’s not a
                    simple task to teach another a spell you know, even if they’re using the same magic system.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The first step is to be taught the basic of the spells. This is an Arcana Skill
                    Challenge with the penalty being set by which type of magic is doing the teaching and learning.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">For instance, a Sourcerer’s understanding of magic is innate, making it hard to
                    articulate how they’re able to do something to someone who understands that same thing through
                    study. In the same way, Wizards and Mages shape magic completely differently than Speakers who shape
                    spells using the Divine Language.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">This takes a 1d4! days of study and teaching, as well as ‘dry’ runs, after which
                    the Check is made.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If it’s successful, the person has the basics and may gain that spell as
                    part of their normal level up (instead of rolling a random spell) or they may learn is instantly,
                    but this takes additional work, costing them CrP to the tune of 25 - the learner’s Int score, as
                    they have to devote additional time to finally cementing it in memory, time that might be taking up
                    with other things.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A failure indicates that more time and study must be taken, increasing
                    the days of study by 1 dice size (d6! days of study for the second try, d10! for the fourth attempt
                    and so on).</p>

                <h1>SHAPE RUDIMENT DESCRIPTIONS</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Note that all shapes glow slightly with strange lumiences, alerting
                    people where the spell is.</p>
                <h3>CIRCLE</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 2</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Circle is the most basic Shape. It extends from the Origin with a
                    Radius equal to the Base Range of the Effect. Anyone within the Circle is affected by the spell. If
                    it deals damage or inflicts Stress, this occurs on the Interval or if a person enters/re-enters the
                    shape. If not cast far enough away, this could also include the caster.</p>
                <h3>CHAIN</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 0</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">This is the most primal Shape a spell can come in. The caster casts the spell and
                    it chooses 1 viable, random target within the Range of the Spell. After half the spell’s Interval,
                    it then leaps to the next. Anyone hit by the spell suffers its Effects for the entire time the spell
                    is cast.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">People may be hit multiple times, which simply counts as the spell
                    Stacking on them, but the caster may try and redirect the spell, causing it to skip over a person,
                    but they take Stress equal to the number of times they’ve done so.</p>
                <h3>CONE</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 3</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The Cone starts with its tip at the Origin and then extends in a 45 degree arch
                    from it up to the spell’s Range. Anyone within the Cone is affected by the spell. If it deals damage
                    or inflicts Stress, this occurs on the Interval or if a person enters/re-enters the shape.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Cone can also be moved and shifted, rotating around its Origin,
                    moving a facing every 3 seconds.</p>
                <h3>SALVO</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 5</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The Salvo is the spell chucked up to its Range from the spell’s Origin. It
                    requires a ranged attack to hit (though ignoring Cover). On a miss, it follows the normal ranged
                    miss rules. Anyone that is hit, suffers the full effects of the spell. If it deals damage or
                    inflicts Stress, this occurs on the Interval.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Those within 10 ft of the Salvo’s touchdown location (even on a total
                    miss) suffer the effects of the spell for half its Interval.</p>
                <h3>SPHERE</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 5</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The spell takes on the shape of a 2 ft diameter sphere that flys around, coming
                    into being at the spell’s Origin. While the caster has complete control over the direction with only
                    minimal effort (so it doesn’t affect what else he’s doing), it still has some limitations. The first
                    is that it only goes 10 ft / second, no faster, no slower, and the caster may only turn it 45
                    degrees every 3 seconds.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Anyone touched by the sphere suffers the Effects of the spell.</p>
                <h3>RAY</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 2</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The ray is a thin line of magic that extends from the spell’s Origin up the 3
                    times the spell’s Range. It manifests in a single instant, requiring a roll to hit, but those that
                    it hits, suffer the full Effect of the spell.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If no one was hit and the spell is still being cast, the caster can
                    manifest another ray and try again until he hits or he decasts the spell.</p>
                <h3>WALL</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 2</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The wall is a line that starts at the spell’s Origin and extends up to its Range,
                    but also into the air and below the ground up to 50 ft. It also doesn’t have to be a straight line,
                    weaving, twisting and turing, however, no part of it can get within 5 ft of another part. It must
                    also be anchored to the ground. The wall cannot be moved once placed.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Anyone passing through the wall is affected by the Spell. Those that are
                    in the wall’s way when it is cast, get a defense roll vs a ranged attack to get out of the way.</p>

                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This makes the Range of a spell just a single individual.</p>
                <h1>ORIGIN RUDIMENT DESCRIPTIONS</h1>
                <h3>AURA</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 5</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This makes it so the Origin starts at the caster (and any equipment he
                    carries) and then extends out from them. </p>
                <h3>TOUCH</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 2</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This makes it so the Origin starts at whatever the caster touches and
                    then extends from there. If the target is trying to resist being touched, the caster needs to make
                    an Unarmed attack against them: the caster is considered armed.</p>
                <h3>NEAR</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 1</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This makes the Origin of the spell up to the Effect’s Base Range.</p>
                <h3>FAR</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DRAIN</strong> 3</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This makes the Origin of the spell up to double the Effect’s Base Range.

                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For example, “Anything Orcish'' counts as 1, “Anything that’s an orc”
                    counts as 2, and “Anything Orish or Elvish” counts as 2 as well.</p>

                <p style="margin:0px;">Demons are notorious shapeshifters and beguilers but through this spell, the
                    summoner is able to force them (somewhat) into a single shape, though this is often a grotesque and
                    twiced form. From there, the caster can order the demon to do their bidding.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">There are different types and categories of demons, each with different abilities
                    that can get a specific job. Some are brutish and stupid, while others are cunning and skillful.
                    Some come linked with certain symbols, such as gateways or the birth of children, that give them
                    powers related to them.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The basic spell conjures just a random demon type, which Circle value is 1, or
                    the lowest rung of the aetherial world that exists between the other realms.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The summoner can also weigh the odds in his favor when it comes to what
                    categories of demon he summons. He can modify the dice roll by his level in either direction</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">A demon appears in a random location within the Shape of the spell and rolls a d3
                    initiative dice.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Demons, even relatively dumb ones, are intelligent creatures and will
                    struggle to overcome their bindings. Anytime you change a demon’s command, the demon rolls a d20 +
                    its Circle (and the Circle of any other demons controlled by the caster) in a one round Conflict. If
                    it wins, the caster loses control and the demon goes rogue, first seeking out the caster to try and
                    kill them as quickly as possible. If it can’t do that, it will do as much damage as possible to
                    what’s around it and then try to kill itself.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The caster can try to cast Bind Demon again to try and regain control.
                    If the Circle you could have summoned is greater than the rogue demon’s Circle, you regain
                    control... for now.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Demons are forced to stay in the area they were summoned in, following
                    it wherever it goes if the Shape can be moved. If it breaks its binding, it may, of course, run
                    free.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Demons are wily creatures, always trying to find loopholes in their orders and
                    while there are implicit bindings in the summon that prevent obvious loophole breaching, they’ll do
                    the bare minimum of what’s asked of them. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">This binding does make them more susceptible to suggestion as well and others may
                    enter into a Conflict with the demon to get it to do or reveal things, on one condition: it can’t go
                    against their summoner’s orders.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, a demon ordered to patrol a hall can be forced to reveal information
                    about its master or how many people are in each room, but it can’t be forced by others to stop
                    patrolling (or even not attack the players, should it be told to kill anyone in the hall).</p>

                    sympathetic elements, giving a form with which it can then move. Without it’s dead kin around, the
                    heart becomes inert and defenseless. So, while there are Order and Chaos Elementals, neither of
                    those two things have a physical manifestation in the Middle Realm and so they simply lay there.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">A conjured elemental with a Weird of d4!. The higher the Weird, the more powerful
                    the elemental. Stats for elementals are found in the <a target="_blank"

                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Elementals are ‘liquid’ and can shift and change their form. Their Weird
                    can be invested to increase their baseline stats and special abilities. How much this costs is
                    determined by the type of heart summoned. Weird can assigned at the time of summoning but also
                    rearranged after, though this takes 1 second per point shift</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A summoned elemental heart appears in a random location within the Shape
                    of the spell, determined by d12 for direction (12 being where the caster is facing and 6 being
                    directly behind him) and d20 for distance, and rolls a d12 initiative dice. During this time, the
                    elemental is getting its barings and forming itself proper.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Elementals are intelligent creatures and will struggle to overcome their
                    bindings. Anytime you change an elemental’s command, the elemental rolls a d8! + its Weird (and the
                    Weird of any other elementals controlled by the caster) in a one round Conflict. If it wins, the
                    caster loses control and the elemental goes rogue, first seeking out the caster to try and kill them
                    as quickly as possible</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The caster can try to cast Bind Elemental Heart again to try and regain
                    control. If the Weird you could have summoned is greater than the rogue elemental’s Weird, you
                    regain control... for now.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">If this spell is cast in any other Shape than Circle, the elemental is forced
                    into that shape and unless the Shape can be moved, the elemental is rooted to the spot, only able to
                    attack people who get within their Measure of that spot.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Shapes that require a roll to hit (Salvo and Ray) and do count that as the

                    instead of just the standard Encumbrance.</p>

                    happens within 1 second. This is a battle of wills. The winner of the Conflict takes full control

                <p style="margin:0px;">While traveling in this form, the person is almost transparent, requiring a
                    Heroic level Perception Check to notice something off. The spirit can travel up to 10 miles per
                    hour, unhampered by terrain. The astral projection can’t speak or interact with the Middle Realm;
                    simply passing through walls and objects but stopped by magical wards and living beings.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">It’s recommended that you return to your body before the spell is released.
                    Otherwise, your spirit is automatically thrown back into your body, which is an upsetting
                    experience, and nets you 1 Stress per mile you are away from your body.</p>

                    killed in which case he’s trapped as spirit between worlds, which is a bummer.</p>

                    the 3D world may interact with them. They remain plastered on the nearest flat surface, bending
                    freely around corners as if it’s nothing and slipping through cracks.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Those in 3D space can interact with them, dealing damage if they’re facing

                    binds the escaped spirit to its body, forcing a horrible bastardization of life.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">This affects all the dead in the Shape of the spell, regardless of how long it’s
                    been dead for. This can bring them back as a skeleton or zombie based on how much meat is left.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The body continues to deteriorate, however, subtracting 10 from the max Vitality
                    of the Bound Spirit for every month the spell wears on.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">This bound spirit is stunted in many ways, as its mind and body still rots away.
                    The bound spirit starts at its full Vitality but is unable to heal wounds by natural, magic, or
                    divine means. Additionally, they’re unable to heal Stress. They’re also unable to gain Experience or
                    level and their Honor is permanently set at Dishonorable. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">But it’s not all bad: the bound spirit is immune to the effects of Encumbrance,
                    though that prevents them from using the Grit Advanced Rule.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STACK</strong> Slow the deterioration by 1.

                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EFFECT</strong> The Hookgate is a spell developed by
                    conjurers that harnesses the innate teleportation abilities of their Weird Tradition. The caster
                    creates a summoning circle and links it to an object, normally a scrap of paper or small stone. When
                    it is destroyed, the person who did so is taken back to a random location within the Shape of the
                    original casting.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">You may only have one Hookgate active at a time. Casting this spell again
                    destroys any previous summoning circles.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The sudden jerk while being summoned is not at all comfortable and so the
                    summonees gain 5 Stress for every 15 miles they travel.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STACK</strong> You can bind an additional
                    object. If one is destroyed, all those holding a token are transported back with their tokens also

                    fall. This increases the effective fall distance within the Shape of the spell by 10 ft. Should
                    anyone start Bleeding Out because of a fall within the Area of Effect, they burst into flames and
                    die instantly. Note that, this counts for even the most minor changes in evaluation, so someone’s
                    footing becoming uneven suddenly does the damage of a 10 ft fall. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STACK</strong> Increase the effective fall

                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EFFECT</strong> Constructed by ancient wizards, the
                    Improbable Stair was a means for the magi of ancient times to travel great distances instantly,
                    however, since the deaths of the old masters, the secrets of how to use the properly Improbable
                    Stair effectively have disappeared.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The Stair is accessed by seeing a stair in an unlikely place but within the Shape
                    of the spell; a pile of crates or a sketch on a wall. It only has to suggest that a stair is there
                    to work. The caster then steps on to the ‘stair’ and onto the Stair.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Every minute on the Stair allows the caster to travel d12! yards if walking, d12!
                    miles if jogging, or d12! days’ travel if running, rolled secretly by the GM.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Others can be brought along by gripping hands with the caster and with each other
                    but should they let go while climbing, they’ll be lost somewhere in time and space.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STACK</strong> You gain more control over
                    where you end up: shift the result of the travel distance dice up or down by 1.</p>

                    organic portion of that person must be held (skin, hair, teeth, or so on).</p>

                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EFFECT</strong> This shapes magic into a spectral
                    platform that allows the mage to dump his excess baggage on it. It happily follows it’s summoner
                    around until it dematerializes, holding up to 1 Medium item.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The basic shape is a disc, but this can be changed to the caster’s desired shape
                    to better hold things, such as a bowl or hand shape but can only be as large as the Shape.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">No matter the shape or size, the platform is translucent purple and is incapable
                    of articulated action. So, a hand shaped platform can hold a weapon, but it's unable to use it to
                    fight: it simply sits there in the air, inert.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Liminal Platforms can be lowered to the ground or up to a max of the hip height
                    of the caster (from the ground. You can’t raise it to your hip, get on it and then raise it again).
                    The platform doesn’t move if the caster is on top of it.</p>

                    changing yourself to look more muscular doesn’t actually make you more muscular.</p>

                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EFFECT</strong> By means of this spell, the caster
                    can animate a Small object in the Shape of the spell, causing it to move about without being
                    touched. The object in question only moves by hops and at points of articulation, so it doesn’t gain
                    the ability to bend unnaturally.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">In this way, a teapot or candlestick may hop about in a primitive form of
                    locomotion, while a lock may only move it’s tumblers and an actual puppet may move as a person does,
                    though this control is crude.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STACK</strong> Increase the size of the

                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EFFECT</strong> This allows the caster to create a
                    phantom noise anywhere within the Shape of the spell. This can be any sound, though it can’t be
                    louder than a yell. Those listening make a Check + 15 to detect that something is wrong with the
                    sound but only after they become suspicious of it.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>STACK</strong> Reduce the bonus that

                    shields, giving them an additional point of Parry and projectiles are less affected by wind

                    their nose or refusing to breathe in from that point forward) that is forfeit.</p>

                    painful process and is not kind to the body. This heals 1d4! points of damage off a single wound of
                    each target and inflicting that much Stress.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">If the damage healed is greater than the target’s Wound Category, it triggers a

                    Spells with the Near and Far Origins are d6 ft/d10 ft closers or further away from where the caster
                    meant them.</p>

                    illusion up to 5 ft x 5 ft anywhere within the Shape of the spell, that may be placed either on the
                    ground or as a freestanding ‘wall’. This illusion hooks into the minds present but has no weight or
                    substance to it, so anyone touching it immediately knows something is up (though touch doesn’t
                    dismiss the illusion).</p>

                    sideways freell, with their feet on the wall and their body out-stretched as if standing. Other than
                    this looking very odd, normal physics apply. Their movement is limited, however: people moving on
                    this wall can only move up to a Crawl.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Crawling on a magic wall doesn’t cause its spell to be cast on that person.</p>

                <h1>ANATOMY OF THE DIVINE</h1>
                <h3>COVENANTS</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Divines have spheres of power that represent their aspects. These are
                    codified into Covenants, or promises they make with their servants in exchange for a portion of the
                    Divine’s power.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Cults of that Divine typically pick one, maybe two Covenants, of their chosen
                    Divine to focus on.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">For instance, Wülder, a Gothic god, watches over Raiding, Industry and Trade.
                    There could be 3 different priests to Wülder, one focusing on his role as the Bridge Between Men,
                    one seeing him as primarily a watcher over people going on cattle raids, and one worshiping him as
                    the greater crafter and source of inspiration.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">While they all worship the same Divine, the Miracles they can invoke in his name
                    are different.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">This means that priests of different cults may not get along with each
                    other and there can even be intra-faith wars to purge heretics (those that focus on different
                    Covenant from them).</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The main bonus of Covenants is that they make Miracles within them
                    easier to invoke. The specifics are elaborated on in the Invoking Miracles section below.</p>
                <h3>COSMIC LINKS</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The Higher Planes are those that exist above the crude and primitive
                    world and so, naturally, the Divines are linked to the events and behaviors of the celestial bodies
                    that make their homes in the heavens.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">A Cosmic Link is the specific celestial body that the Divine is
                    associated with and it usually gives an insight to the personality of the god. The Cosmic Link
                    doesn’t necessarily mean your Patron is primarily the Divine of that Cosmic thing. So, a Divine
                    associated with the moon might not be primarily a moon god, in the same way that while Venus was
                    associated with the Morning Star, she was primarily viewed as a love goddess by the Romans. Still,
                    your holy symbols may incorporate the moon motif commonly to represent her.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For clarification’s sake: when something says “decrease” in this
                    section’s explanations, you go down the chart by that many steps. If it says “increase” go up, so
                    increase will always be a bonus, and decrease will always be bad.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>COMET </strong>This is associated with fervent but
                    fleeting powers. Whenever you invoke a Miracle, you gain two Honor Dice with a +3 but lose an
                    additional Favor.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>EVENING STAR </strong>The evening star is a source
                    of strength and beauty: it's the first star to rise in the evening. When you invoke a Miracle, if
                    you roll below the average, you gain the average instead. So, if you roll d8 and get a 3 or less,
                    you get 4 instead.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MOON </strong>The moon is a steady force, its
                    effects are subtle but constant. When you invoke a Miracle, if you roll two Honor Dice, keeping the
                    highest.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MORNING STAR </strong>The morning star is the last
                    star in the heavens before day and is a lone watcher. When you invoke a Miracle and roll the minimum
                    amount, you don’t lose any Favor.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SUN </strong>The sun is the lord of heaven, strong
                    and unbending, its power unquestioned. When you invoke a Miracle and roll the max amount, you don’t
                    lose any Favor.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CYCLICAL </strong>Often hailing from older, more
                    primitive times, the Cyclical deity represents earthly inevitabilities in a dichotomy, sometimes
                    with themselves and sometimes with an opposing deity. This can be Spring and Summer, life and death,
                    creation and destruction. They may be weak now, but they will wax unstoppable. When you invoke a
                    Miracle, and roll under its average, your next Miracle gains a +1. This is cumulative.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">If you roll above its average, this bonus is then removed and you get a -1 to
                    your next Miracle. Again, this is cumulative and resets when you roll below.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, if you have a d6! Honor Dice, and you roll a 2, the next Miracle you
                    invoke gets a +1. That next Miracle you roll, you get a 3 for a total of 4 (because of the +1),
                    giving you a +2 the next roll. On that roll, you roll a 5 for a total of 7 ( 5 + 2 ). The next
                    Miracle you then invoke gets a -1.</p>
                <h1>FAVOR OF THE DIVINES</h1>
                <h3>WHAT IS FAVOR?</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Favor is a measure of your standing with a given god. It’s not an
                    absolute measure, however, but more a measure of the chance that a Divine will answer your prayer.
                    How far your Favor goes ranges widely based on how devoted you are to a god and how Honor you are.
                </p>
                <h3>LEVELS OF DEVOTION</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There are 3 levels of commitment to a Covenant, that determine how often
                    you get Favor and how much Favor you can have:</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>UNANOINTED </strong>are the lowest level: those
                    outside the cult and its mysteries. They gain no benefits of any kind.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ANOINTED </strong>are those that are the lay members
                    of the faith. They gain small bonuses to their max Favor for the deity they’re devoted to. You can
                    only be anointed to one Covenant at a time.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">If you have a positive Devotion to a deity, one of their cults, or one of their
                    Covenants, you can choose to begin the game as an anointed to that deity. Otherwise, you can become
                    Anointed during gameplay once you have that Devotion.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">You can only be anointed to one deity at a time.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SERVANTS </strong>are the highest rung of
                    the commitment ladder and serve as the officers of the cult of the god. They’re priests, abbots,
                    hierophants, pontiffs, nazarites, hermits, etc.. These are men and women that have taken vows to
                    devote their life to the cult. In game terms, this means that these are those who have a Servant
                    Archetype as either their Primary or Secondary Archetype.</p>
                <h3>ACQUIRING FAVOR</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Servants turn their eyes from the earth below to higher worlds, both
                    literally and metaphorically. In this way, they’re the keeper of the times and seasons, as well as
                    the calendar to note the occurrence of Holy Days.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">As such, players who play Servants will need to keep track of the passage of
                    time. Doing so gives them special bonuses according to the schedule laid out below. You’ll note that
                    it follows the Gregorian Calendar layout with holy days happening according to the Judeo-Christian
                    traditions. The assumption that the characters will be following an in-game calendar with random
                    Holy Days specific to their cult but we’re “translating” into the Gregorian calendar, in the same
                    way that we assume the characters are actually speaking in their native fantasy tongues and not in
                    English. Doing this makes it easier for players to keep track because the calendar is a familiar
                    shape. They won’t have to track out a whole year and remember that Beltane is on the 5th of Seed’s
                    Row. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Rules for using your own calendar and keeping all Servants relatively
                    balanced against each other is going to be the Advanced Rules.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Favor is unique to the Divine you’re petitioning. Gaining Favor with
                    another Divine, means that you lose an equal amount of Favor with all others because gods are bad at
                    sharing.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DAILY SACRIFICES (EVERY DAY) </strong>These are
                    small, daily sacrifices. These tend to cost about 1 or 2 sc, 5 to 6 points of Stress, or 1 or 2
                    Vitality, depending on your Divine's preferences. They can be the sacrifice of a small, sacred
                    animal, the burning of a portion of your meal, or the lighting of incense during morning prayers.
                    They net 1 Favor for Servants of that Divine.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SABBATIC HOLY DAY (EVERY 7 DAYS) </strong>This is a
                    day of rest and contemplation, where the faithful are instructed to put aside the things of the
                    world and focus on the Divine with activities related to their Covenant. There is an emphasis on
                    ritual over practicality to emphasize this divide, so while a Divine of Battle encourages his
                    followers to fight every day, on his sabbath he only wants them to focus on ritualistic combat and
                    controlled bloodshed, as opposed to actual combat. Again, this is to remind his followers of the
                    holiness of the action and by forcing his followers to stop and think about their actions, he forces
                    them to contemplate the deeper realities of combat. The sabbath takes up 1 to 3 hours and the rest
                    of the day can be spent at the faithful wants.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Servants who observe the sabbath of their Divine gain all Favor back, while
                    anointed worshippers gain their Min Favor from Charisma if they roll a 4 or better on their highest
                    Devotion die related to that Divine. Unanointed worshippers gain nothing.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>LUNAR HOLY DAY (4 SABBATIC HOLY DAYS) </strong>Where
                    normal Sabbaths are days of rest, Lunar Holy Days are about sacrifices and consecration, which are
                    thematically appropriate to the cult’s Covenant. Those observing the holy day need to stop and spend
                    the whole day or they gain no benefit.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Servants gain all Favor back plus extra Favor equal to their Min Favor. This
                    extra Favor is reset on the next Lunar Holy Day (which means you can’t stockpile it). The Anointed
                    gain all Favor back, while the unanointed who celebrate gain 1 Favor.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>SOLAR HOLY DAY (EVERY 3 LUNAR HOLY DAYS)
                    </strong>These holy days celebrate the turning of the seasons and where the other festivals can be
                    severe, with fasting and reading and nerd stuff like that, Solar Holy Days are about feasting and
                    letting loose a bit. The Divines demand their faithful to party all day.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Servants gain all Favor back plus extra Favor equal to a roll of their Devotion
                    die. This extra Favor is reset on the next Solar Holy Day (which means you can’t stockpile it). The
                    anointed faithful gain their full Favor back and the unanointed gain their Min Favor from Charisma
                    if they roll a 4 or better on their highest Devotion die related to that Divine.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>ANNUAL HOLY DAY (EVERY 4 SOLAR HOLY DAYS)
                    </strong>The Annual Holy Day either celebrates the new year or an important event in the cult, such
                    as the birth of their messiah or the founding of their faith. It is a 2 day affair and is often
                    occupied by feasting, gift giving, public rituals, and other such nonsense.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Servants and Anointed followers gain all Favor back with Servants also
                    gaining extra Favor equal to the max of their Devotion die and the Anointed followers gaining extra
                    Favor equal to a roll of their Devotion die. For Servants, this extra Favor is reset on the next
                    Annual Holy Day (which means you can’t stockpile it). The unanointed gain 1 Favor</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TAKING AN OATH (SPECIAL) </strong>Not a sacrifice or
                    holy day parse, Taking an Oath is essentially getting Favor on loan from the Divines for the promise
                    that, if you get out the bad situation you're in, you'll make a huge sacrifice to them soon after.
                    By Taking an Oath, you gain a die worth of Favor for every 20% of treasure you gain from the
                    adventure you promise to the Divine, should you survive.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">This die is equal to the highest Devotion die related to the Divine you're
                    petitioning if you're Anointed to them. The Unanointed must also promise to become Anointed in
                    addition to the cash and goods, in which case they gain a d8! worth of Favor. This Favor can put you
                    over your max but must be spent on a Miracle immediately. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The Divines are extremely litigious. If you don't fulfill your oath in 1 month +
                    1 for every Honor Category higher than Average Honor you're in, they will seek vengeance. You may no
                    longer gain any Favor with any Divine that shares a pantheon with the one you're in and what you do
                    have will decay, causing you to lose 1 Favor per day. Priests of the Divine will also condemn you as
                    an oath breaker, a very serious accusation, causing you to drop 1 Honor Category per month and
                    preventing you from increasing your Honor. Should you fall into Dishonor, you gain the
                    Excommunicated Flaw.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CRUSADES & PILGRIMAGES (SPECIAL) </strong>There are
                    holy places to visit and holy things to be done. Crusades and Pilgrimages are special rewards the GM
                    can give out for furthering the Divine’s will. This can either be through an actual holy war or by
                    waging a spiritual war of conversion. These don’t even need to be things done on purpose and can be
                    part of the campaign. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The GM should award a roll of the crusader or pilgrim's Devotion dice, allowing
                    it to go over the Max Favor allowed, and awarding them Honor and Fame for furthering their deity’s
                    influence in the Middle Realm. Additionally, if it was an amazing feat of faith, the GM may also
                    increase the character’s Devotion dice size. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The unanointed gain no benefit from crusades and pilgrimages.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>CONDEMNATION & ABSOLUTION (SPECIAL)
                    </strong>Servants and Anointed followers are expected to hold to the Divine’s tenets more closely
                    and so can come under condemnation for disobeying their deity. GMs may subtract Favor from Servants
                    and Anointed followers for sins against their religion or prevent them from gaining Favor for
                    prolonged transgressions. Servants and Anointed followers with the Religion Advanced Skill in their
                    Covenant receive a warning before they act (having studied their religion to some extent).</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Those that have transgressed must seek absolution before they gain the
                    benefit of holy days and sacrifices again. What this means varies based on the magnitude of the sin.

                <h3>MAXIMUM FAVOR</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;">A person can only have so much Favor, with the Divines giving a little extra
                    leeway for those of strong character. The Max Favor a person can have is limited to their Honor
                    Category.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Anointed members increase this threshold by 1 while Servants increase their Max
                    Favor by their level, but both cannot gain any Favor while in the Dishonorable Category, regardless
                    of level.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Should a person drop an Honor Category, if their Favor is above their
                    new max, it automatically drops.</p>
                <h1>INVOKING MIRACLES</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Now that you’ve got a nice stash of Favor, you probably want to spend
                    it. That’s pretty simple: pray out loud for the Miracle in question. Silent prayers don’t work
                    because no Divine is going to answer a prayer they’re not going to get credit for.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For every Favor you spend, you get another use of your Honor Dice but
                    comes with a few differences: the first, and most major, is that you can spend it on ANYTHING - you
                    want to run faster or jump higher? You want to heal your wounds? You want to attack slightly faster?
                    You can with Favor, however, the effects are only temporary, of course.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">The second is that you can spend to change the world around you. Every Favor you
                    spend can change a 5 ft square area with the following restriction: it can’t directly contradict
                    things that have already been said.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For instance, you cannot wish to have an avalanche suddenly on the
                    steppe or an inn to appear before the party that wasn’t there before, but you could wish for a flash
                    flood or for an inn to be over the next rise, which was just out of view when you prayed.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Miracles are also bound by Covenant: you can’t pray for something your Divine
                    doesn’t have power over, so a Divine of the city can’t really help you in the mountains, for
                    example.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">But this is where being in a pantheon does help out: you can pray to
                    another Divine in your pantheon for their blessing instead, but it requires twice as much Favor and
                    you don’t gain the benefit of your Cosmic Link.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The other restriction is that the Miracles need to be subtle: no angels
                    coming down from the skies to keep you from falling to your death but perhaps there’s water or a
                    passing hay cart that catches you just in time to soften your landing. There needs to be room for
                    doubt.</p>
                <h3>SACRED & PROFANE SPACES</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Holy places are those areas that are closer to the God’s Realm, where the Middle
                    Realm is weaker. There the faithful can almost feel the Divines walking around.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">In a sacred space dedicated to a certain Divine, the Honor Dice you get becomes 1
                    size larger. It also fills the devoted with a sense of purpose, temporarily increasing their
                    Devotion dice size by 1 for Conflicts and, if defending the space, their Devotion applies to Morale,
                    of course.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">There are also those areas that are abhorrent to the gods. Desecrated altars,
                    dwarven holds, and other spaces the Divine presence is absent.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These Profane spaces net Honor Dice 1 size smaller, down to a d2 for
                    each Favor spent to the Divine space is Profane to. The unanointed are completely unable to invoke
                    Miracles.</p>
                <h5>Character Progression</h5>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> A person who sets off on an adventure doesn’t return the same person as they
                    were when they left. Trials and hardships not only hone their skill, but also who they are and what
                    they stand for. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> In Bonfire, this change is measured by Experience (Ex), which is
                    counted at the end of every session.</p>
                <h1>GAINING EXPERIENCE</h1>

                </table>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> The only way to gain Experience is to move towards your Goals or help others
                    move towards theirs.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> At the end of each session, if you've moved towards a Goal, whether your own or
                    another player's, whether your character knew about it or not, you gain 25 Ex. If you moved towards
                    additional Goals, you get a extra 10 Ex for each one you helped with. However, they only get the
                    bonus Ex for helping another person if their goals aren't identical to yours.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> So, let's say that you moved towards one of your Goals and helped another person
                    with their's. You would get 35 Ex (25 + 10). Or let's say that there wasn't enough time to do
                    anything on your Goal, but you managed to help two other players; you'd still get 35 Ex at the end
                    of the session (25 for the first, 10 for the second). Or, or, if you were a real wonderkind, and
                    moved towards your Goal AND helped the two other players, you'd get 45 Ex (25 + 10 + 10). </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There is a bonus of another 25 Ex for each member if everyone in the
                    party has moved towards their Goals that session.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> On top of this, if a party member actually completes one of their
                    Goals, they (and anyone else who helps them) gains an additional 25% of their current Ex and a bonus
                    of 25% of your current Fame as well at 5 Honor (though this only applies to the person who completed
                    it).</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The GM may award additional Ex for completing plot important points in
                    the story.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> You don’t receive Ex for random things, such as winning a Social Conflict,
                    Combats, or Skill Challenges. Those are more about gaining Honor.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> You gain Ex for challenging who your character is. If they gain Ex from a Combat
                    it is not from just defeating a random foe or just being in Combat. It could be from your character
                    facing their fears or rival, killing a person for the first time, or learning to be a leader in a
                    stressful situation.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Those things are a means to an end, not an end in and of themselves.
                </p>
                <h1>LEVELING UP</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Once a character has received enough Ex to level, they must take a week to think
                    and meditate on what they’ve learned.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> During this week, they reflect on their journey and how they’ve
                    changed. Each day, they complete one of the steps of leveling up.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This self-reflection takes a large amount of the day. If the character
                    is interrupted by any strenuous activity, they’ve lost the day and must pick up their reflection
                    when they can from the same point.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> For example, If Ironfoe is on day 3 of his reflection when his battle brothers
                    decide to do a raid on a local village 2 days away, to be able to join in, he must break off his
                    leveling (having gained his CrP and increased his Stat Scores but not having assessed how he sees
                    himself).</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When the raid is over, and he’s returned to his clan stronghold, 4 days
                    later, he can pick up where he left off and rethink what he’s doing with his life.</p>
                <h3>DAY 1: RECEIVE CrP</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> At the start of his reflection, a character receives a number of CrP equal to
                    his LvL CrP from his Intellect. This behaves exactly like CrP from Character Creation and can be
                    used to buy things at any stage or reroll everything but Vitality.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You can spend these are different points over the level up process but
                    you can also save them up to purchase more expensive things if you don’t currently have enough CrP
                    for what you want.</p>
                <h3>DAY 2: INCREASE STAT SCORES</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Today you may spend CrP to improve any of your Scores as per Step 6 of
                    <strong>Chapter 1: Character Creation.</strong> </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> At 3rd level and every 5 levels after that (8, 13, 18, etc.), you may increase 1
                    of your Stats by 1</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And at 5th level and every 5 levels after that (10, 15, 20, etc.), you
                    increase a random Stat by 1. This is rolled on a d6, with 1 being Strength and 6 being Charisma. You
                    may influence with your Honor or spend 15 CrP for a reroll. </p>
                <h3>DAY 3: ASSESS PERSONALITY </h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FLAWS</strong> A character can grow, overcoming
                    things that used to hold her down. A character can buy off a mental or behavioral Flaw for its CrP
                    bonus (regardless of how much you got for it). If you do so, you gain a 2d6 Trait “Overcame X” with
                    X being the Flaw. Background Flaws that have resolved through play can also give you this Trait
                    according to the GM's discretion.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TRAITS</strong> As a character grows, things that
                    used to be important to them no longer are and things they never used to identify with become a part
                    of them.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> A character can switch around their Traits, switching a Strong one for a Medium
                    one, or a Medium one for a Weak one. This swaps the number of dice - not the size of those dice. So,
                    swapping a 1d8 trait for 3d10 trait makes one 3d8 and the other 1d10.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> They may also swap out a Weak one for an entirely new one.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> After 3rd level, they may only do this swap once per level, however. Before
                    then, you may swap your Traits around freely: after all, you may still be getting on your feet in
                    terms of the type of character that would best fit in the group and campaign. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>PASSIONS</strong> Passions die out and are relit. A
                    character may increase the size of a Passion by decreasing the size of another.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> This can drop the Passion to below 1, allowing the character to develop a new
                    one.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> After 3rd level, you may only do this trade once per level. Before that, you may
                    swap around your Passions freely.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>GOALS</strong> During this time, the character
                    carefully turns over their aims in life and can ask themselves if this is really the path they want
                    to travel down.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Goals may be switched out, dropped or added freely at this stage but
                    can't total more than 3.</p>
                <h3>DAY 4: INCREASE CLASS ABILITIES</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Some Class Abilities grew stronger as you level. Check your selected
                    Archetypes to see if they have any of their Abilities that either grow stronger (i.e. the Thug’s
                    Precision Strike), gain additional free Skills (i.e. any of the Expert Archetype’s Skill Focuses),
                    or gain something else for free (i.e. the Caster Archetypes gaining new Rudiments). </p>
                <h3>DAY 5: TRAIN AND RETRAIN SKILLS & MASTERIES </h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Now, it’s time to hone in on what you’ve learned and any new skills you’ve
                    acquired or hidden talents you’ve discovered during your travels.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At this stage you may spend your CrP to purchase and improve your
                    Skills and Masteries.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> A character may also replace old knowledge with new. He may refund one of his
                    Masteries and Skill purchases, gaining the CrP he spend on them back to spend on something else.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After 3rd level, he may only do this once per level up for each. Before
                    that point, he may do this freely. He can never refund free Masteries or Skills earned from his
                    Archetypes.</p>
                <h3>DAY 6: INCREASE VITALITY</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Finally, it’s time to reflect on the fact that your travels have made you just a
                    little bit tougher, a little bit better at facing what life throws at you.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> At every even level, the character gets a free reroll of their Vitality Die from
                    their last level, taking the higher of the two rolls, however, if both rolls are under their Minimum
                    Vitality from their Constitution, they receive that value at least.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> At every odd level, they gain a free roll that’s added to their total
                    Vitality. This is not affected by their Con’s Min Vitality and is just a straight roll. You’ll need
                    to record it on your character sheet.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> If your Class has a “choose the higher of 2” for their Vitality die, your
                    Vitality Dice drops to one of those dice. So, “the higher of 2d6” becomes a single d6 for subsequent
                    levels.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Remember to recalculate your Wound Categories</p>
                <h3>DAY 7: RECEIVE HONOR</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Now the other players will silently judge the character, rating him 1
                    to 10 in 3 categories: Flaws, Teamwork, Respect.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>FLAWS</strong> How well has this player played their
                    Flaws? Do they only seem to be brought up when it’s convenient but then forgotten they need to get
                    away with something?</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Does she use her Flaws to further the story and character development or does
                    she use them to annoy others? </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> A character that leans more to the former, rather than the latter, deserves a
                    higher score.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>TEAMWORK</strong> Does this player work well with
                    others? Do they pull their load and put themselves on the line or do they pick fights that derail
                    the session? Are they on top on things and help set up or are they late and spend all their time on
                    the phone?</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Again, a character that leans more to the former, rather than the latter,
                    deserves a higher score.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>RESPECT</strong> How do you think this
                    character is viewed by those he interacts with, by both the party’s character and NPCs? Has he kept
                    his word (or at least, not gotten caught) or does he have a habit of backstabbing other?</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The GM should then take the scores and average them across each
                    category and then subtract 5 from each of them. Those three modified averages are then totaled: this
                    is how much Honor they gain or lose.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> For example, Claire receives scores of 5, 4, and 6 for her Flaws, 3, 5, 1 for
                    her Teamwork, and 10, 8, 10 for Respect, giving her an average of 5 (0 after the -5) for Flaws, 3
                    (-2) for Teamwork, and 10 (5) for Respect.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Totaling the modified average, she gains 3 Honor</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The individual scores and who gave them should be kept a secret, though
                    the player can know how much they scored in each category to help them improve.</p>
                <h5>Miscellaneous Rules</h5>
                <h1>STAT SCORE DAMAGE</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Stat Score damage occurs in several places and it’s fairly straightforward. Then
                    why have this section, you ask? As a quick aside to keep the game moving.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> The sudden change in ability is incredibly unnerving, meaning that until the
                    person can stop, take a breath and re-adjust to their new reality (meaning the player can adjust the
                    stats on his character sheet without breaking off Combat, a Conflict, a Challenge or any narrative
                    tension the GM has built up), he gets a penalty of 1 for each point lost to any thing that Stat
                    Score influences. So, a -3 to Dexterity would net a temporary -3 to Attack, and Defense, +3 to
                    Initiative, all while reducing the Social Die by 3 sizes, if applicable.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If the amount drained is more than the score, the person becomes
                    appropriately incapacitated, but not dead, until the Stat Score damage is healed.</p>
                <h1>DISEASES & POISONS</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">These rules will reference poisons, as they’re the most common use case,
                    but they equally apply to disease. You’ll notice that, while they use Conflicts as their base,
                    they’re using the exact same rules as Bleeding Out in Combat, only the variables will change based
                    on the poison - so if you know those rules, you know these. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There are 4 dimensions to a poison: its Strength, Speed, Lethality and
                    Symptoms.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Poisons are handled like Conflicts, with each round happening as noted
                    by its Speed starting at the time the poison is injected.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Like with Bleeding Out, points don’t matter; only successes and failures do. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">A failure denotes that the symptoms are getting worse. Symptoms are what the
                    poison attacks. This could be one of the character’s Stat Scores, their Stress, their Encumbrance or
                    any combination of these choices. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">If one the character’s Stat Score falls below 0, the Stat Score damage
                    is then done to their Vitality in a single Wound that simply becomes more severe. In the case of
                    Stress, Vitality starts to be eaten away when you reach your Stress Threshold.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Every success counts against the Lethality of the poison. If you reach a number
                    of successes equal to the Lethality, the poison begins to wane: each success recovers a point while
                    each failure simply keeps them where they are. Once the person has completely recovered, the
                    Conflict is over. This also cures any Stress or Encumbrance specifically inflicted by the poison.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Other character's can add their Medicine Skill as an additional dice
                    each round to help.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Finally, the poison’s Strength represents how many d4!s that start
                    rolling each round. Each round this increases by 1 dice size until the infected person fails at
                    which point it drops back down to rolling it’s Strength again. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">So, Blue Glory is a fairly weak poison at 1/5 seconds/Strength. That
                    means that if the person infected loses the round, they subtract 1 from their Strength.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">For example, Naadesh is bit by a spider and it deals enough to get
                    through his armor. The spider’s venom is rated 3/1 minute/3/Dex. In the first round the poison rolls
                    3d4! and he rolls a 2d6! and scores higher, not losing Dex.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Naadesh continues to fight the infection but after a minute, the next round
                    starts, with the poison rolling 3d6!. He antes up 1d12! and succeeds again, not losing any Dex.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Another minute passes. This round the poison is rolling 3d8! and he 3d6!. He
                    fails this time, losing 1 point of Dex.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">A minute passes and this time, the poison is reset to 3d4! again because it won
                    last round, he succeeds, gaining the three successes he needs.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Another minute passes. This round is vs 3d6! again but he is able to
                    roll 4d8!, beating the total and recovering his lost Dex.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">There’s no germ theory in the world of Bonfire and so illnesses are seen
                    as mysterious forces controlled by the Divines, that can be controlled and even less understood. As
                    such, there won’t be any discussion here about how a particular disease is spread and how to avoid
                    it. GM’s should use them as they see fit for plot purposes and have logical ways of catching it,
                    however, should the players get really into trying to deduce the logic behind it, the GM should feel
                    free to change the ways to catch it to throw them off.</p>
                <h1>FALLING DAMAGE</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> When your character falls, they take damage based on how far that
                    surpasses their DR from armor, however, they can do somethings to help their decent.</p>

                <h1>ILLUMINATION</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> For sake of simplicity, there’s five categorization of how much light
                    there is in an area:</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BLINDING</strong> This is like staring into the sun.
                    It's very painful and not very pleasant.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Assuming that you cover your eyes, you'll be acting as if you're blind. Even
                    then, a moment's exposure even temporarily results in a d10! second delay as you try to recover. If
                    you continue to expose yourself to this level of illumination, you'll be unable to act at all and
                    will do blind in a number of seconds equal to your Con.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>BRIGHT</strong> This is the level of light of
                    starting into a fire or just having your eyes near it. It sucks but it probably won't do permanent
                    damage.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> This doesn't really affect your aim or anything like that but it does make it
                    difficult to focus on things, delaying any action by 1d4! seconds as you try and squint and see what
                    you're doing.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> It also lowers any Skill Checks that require sight by 2.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>NORMAL</strong> This is normal daylight and occurs
                    no operating penalties.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DIM-LIGHTING</strong> This the equivalent of a dark
                    room or night time. There’s some visibility; the character can make out shapes and shadows but no
                    fine details.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> In melee combat, those in dim-lighting defend and attack with a 1d12! and using
                    ranged weapons is even more of challenge. However, if you insist, you’ll be attacking with a 1d6!.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Any Skill Challenges that require sight have their difficulties increased by 2.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Additionally, Sprinting is impossible without acquiring a Stress per second
                    moved.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DARK</strong> This is pitch black with the character
                    not even being able to see their hands in front of their faces. This is a dungeon after the torch
                    goes out.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Combat becomes difficult as anyone in darkness defends and attacks with a 1d6!
                    And ranged combat is right out, but, if you insist, you’ll be attacking with a 1d4.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Any Skill Challenges that require sight have their Rank halved.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And moving above Strolling speed is extremely nerve racking, netting a
                    Stress per Speed Category per second. So, moving at a Run for 3 seconds gives you 9 Stress (3 for
                    the Run for 3 seconds).</p>
                <h1> src="../../../assets/images/lights.png" alt="the different areas of light"</h1>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are currently three sources of light. How they shed their light
                    is noted on the left:</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The white is considered Normal, the light grey is Dimly Lit and the
                    beyond that is Dark, assuming no other light sources are provided.</p>

                </table>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your character isn’t immortal, or at least, they didn’t start out that
                    way, and so still needs to fulfil their basic needs of food, drink, and sleep. Without those basic
                    requirements, he may find himself a bit more lethargic or, worse case scenario, dead.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">There are three things your character needs to take care of, as mentioned above:
                    food, water, and sleep, and three levels at which they either gain penalties or bonuses:
                    Deprivation, Maintenance, and Indulgence. These bonuses and penalties stack.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>DEPRIVATION</strong> is when your character starts
                    to die of starvation, dehydration, and/or sleep deprivation. You take 1 point of damage per day for
                    each time you’re below this threshold. This damage is on 1 Wound doesn’t heal until you bring that
                    thing above above Maintenance again. </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">Eating, drinking, or not sleeping deals 2 points of damage a day so something is
                    better than nothing. Also, when doing a strenous activity (Combat, Conflicts, or Skill Challenges,
                    for example) you gain 2 Stress for each thing you're deprivated off.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>MAINTENANCE</strong> is when your character is
                    getting enough to survive and that’s it. Being below this threshold but above Deprivation offers no
                    bonuses or penalties.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong class='orangeHeader'>INDULGENCE</strong> is eating and sleeping
                    more than you need to but not overeating or over sleeping. Being below this threshold but above
                    Maintenance means that you gain an additional Relaxation that day. This stacks as well, though no
                    additional bonuses for over-indulging.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px;">For example, while out in the wilderness, Olbrecht discovers that he is almost
                    out of food and water. Luckily, he knows a river is two days way and he’s able to scavenge on the
                    way there, but that still means that he’s drinking less then 1/4 a gallon and only eating 3/4 lbs of
                    food.</p>
                <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Over his two days of travel, therefore, he takes 4 points of damage on
                    2 Wounds but he does make it the river. Now, he’s down to 1/4 lbs of food per day but he’s able to
                    drink as much water as he likes, so over the two days getting back to civilization, he takes an
                    additional 2 Wounds from starvation but heals 1 from being able to drink freely again.</p>
                <h3>SMALL & LARGE SIZED CREATURES</h3>
                <p style="margin:0px;"> Obviously, a smaller creature requires less food while a larger one rquires
                    more, so Small sized creatures half each threshold while Large creatures double it.</p>
