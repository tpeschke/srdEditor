|hTEACHING YOUR SPELLS TO OTHERS|pMagic spells are complex things with more layers than an onion, so it’s not a simple task to teach another a spell you know, even if they’re using the same magic system.|pThe first step is to be taught the basic of the spells. This is an Arcana Skill Challenge with the difficulty being set by which type of magic is doing the teaching and learning.|pFor instance, a Sourcerer’s understanding of magic is innate, making it hard to articulate how they’re able to do something to someone who understands that same thing through study. In the same way, Wizards and Mages shape magic completely differently than Speakers who shape spells using the Divine Language.|pThis takes a 1d4! days of study and teaching, as well as ‘dry’ runs, after which the check is made.|lIf it’s successful, the person has the basics and may gain that spell as part of their normal level up (instead of rolling a random spell) or they may learn is instantly, but this takes additional work, costing them CrP to the tune of 25 - the learner’s Int score, as they have to devote additional time to finally cementing it in memory, time that might be taking up with other things.|lA failure indicates that more time and study must be taken, increasing the days of study by 1 dice size (d6! days of study for the second try, d10! for the fourth attempt and so on).|sALTERNATIVE WAYS TO CAST|hSIMULCASTING|lIf you have enough SP, you may cast more than one spell in the same second, however you gain 1 Stress for each additional spell cast this way.|hCONCERT CASTING|pFor Wild Magic-Users, it is possible to unite your spirits and channel together, thus improving your channelling overall.|pWhen Concert Casting, there is a ‘lead’ Magic User who casts the spell. Each person added either their channelling dice reduced by 1 size for each additional person (down to a d4!) who’s also adding dice or reduces the channelling time, though it takes 1 person to reduce it by 1 second, 2 additional people for the next second (so 3 total), and so on.|pTo effectively Concert Cast, all Magic Users must remain linked through physical contact, though not all of them need to touch the lead Magic User you must be able to be able to trace from that channeller to the lead, but beyond that, they must have some connection with each other. Each channeller needs to have a Devotion to the lead Magic User or the casting will simply not work.|lThe lead Magic User takes all the SP from the other and uses it to cast his spell, though he’s still affected by his SP limit and may gain Stress because of it.
