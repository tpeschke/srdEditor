    <div id="exportContent"><h5>Character Creation</h5><h1>1. ROLL STAT SCORES</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character has 6 attributes that define your character physically and mentally. These are Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intellect (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha). More on details are found in <strong>Chapter 2: Stat Scores.</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"> Roll 3d6 for each of these Abilities to generate that score.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This should result in something similar to this:</p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Str: 13</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Dex: 7</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Con: 10</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Int: 14</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Wis: 11</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Cha: 6</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Bonfire is specifically balanced for you to roll 3d6 in order, with 10 being the average result but you’ll have the chance to modify these later so don’t worry too much if you have low scores.</p><h1>2. RECIEVE CrP</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Alright, you have your scores. Now it’s time to decide whether or not if you can reroll them. At this point you’re also going to determine how many Creation Points (or CrP, for short) you’ll start with. These CrP will be spent on modifying your character; buying them their skills and increasing their Scores. They may also be spent on rerolls at certain steps.</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px;"> If you have no score over 13, or 2 under 6, you may choose to reroll for free. Your character just didn’t have it in him to go adventuring.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If that’s not the case and you still want to reroll your stats, you can but you receive 0 CrPs to work with and you’re stuck with your second set of Scores.</p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Even still, you may want to switch your stats around. This may be because you have almost the right stats but you have a specific character concept in mind. For instance, using the example stats in Step 1, your party may need a diplomatic character more than a strong character. In this case, it would really help to swap Strength and Charisma.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> You can freely switch around your stats as need but, in that case, you only receive 25 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If you switch only 4 of your stats, you receive 50 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If you switch 2, you receive 75 CrPs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And if you keep your stats the way they are, with no changes, you gain 100 CrPs to work with.</p><h1>3. SELECT RACE</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character’s race will change how they interact with the world and what they’ll be good and bad at so pick carefully.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Details are found in <strong>Chapter 3: Races</strong> so go there and pick one and come back here when you’re done.</p><h1>4. CHOOSE YOUR ARCHETYPES</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Your character’s class is made of two Archetypes combined.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You choose a Primary and a Secondary Archetype and pay the price in CrP for both based on your race’s Archetype Cost section. Descriptions of the different Archetypes are found in <strong>Chapter 4: Archetypes</strong> along with more details on how to combined them.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve chosen to reroll your stats and have no CrPs to work with, congratulations, you’re now in CrP debt and need to make it up by the end of Character Creation.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You must select two Archetypes before going further.</p><h1>5. RECORD ARCHETYPE ABILITIES</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This is more for Caster Archetypes, as they’ll head over to <strong>Chapter 12: The Weird</strong> to roll their starting spells but now is the time to record any free Skills, or Masteries you obtained free from your class choice, as well as Class Abilities</p><h1>6. ROLLS FLAWS</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> All heroes have flaws. That’s what makes them relatable and human (even if they’re an orc). Character Flaws earn you additional CrP, which is great. Flaws can also be used in social situations to further the story.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> For a list of Flaws flip to <strong>Chapter 5: Flaws.</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve gone into CrP debt and you’re not out of it by the end of this stage, you’ll need to go back and reselect your Archetypes so that you are or go back to you starting set of stats and begin Character Creation all over again with them.</p><h1>7. ADJUST STATS</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Now, it is time to do the final adjustments to your stats. While not your final adjustments: you'll have a chance to increase them again level up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The price to increase a Stat is the Stat + 10. So, to get a Stat to 9 from 8, it would cost 18 CrP.</p><h1>8. CALCULATE CHARACTER VITALS</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Now it’s time to calculate your character’s Honor and Vitality.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> These 2 things, along with Stress are important parts of the game and serve as the prime mechanics when running a Bonfire game. If you’re not familiar with them head over to <strong>Chapter 6: Character Vitals.</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This chapter will also give you an overview of the character sheet that you’ll get more acquainted with later. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’ve already played Bonfire before, here’s a cheat sheet for calculating those things:</p><ul><li>Honor: This is determined by your “Starting Honor” listed under your Charisma</li><li>Vitality: This is Con score + Primary Archetype’s Vitality Die + Vitality Size Modifier from race, divided into 4 Categories.</li></ul><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Don't forget that you get a bonus to your CrP from the Honor of your last character. If this is your first character, you instead get 25 CrP. Enjoy.</p><h1>9. MASTERIES & SKILLS</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Masteries and Skills are additional areas of expertise that your character has obtained above his or her race and class.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> All three cost CrP. Prices and descriptions can be found in <strong>Chapter 8: Skills.</strong></p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class="sidebarTitle">Out of Order Character Creation</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you’re a little bit more familiar with Bonfire Character creation, these last steps (step 9, 10, and 11) can be taken in any order you’d like, even skipping back and forth between them.</p></td></tr></table><h1>10. DEFINE SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your character is more than just raw stats, skills, and abilities. At this step, you’re going to define more about who they see themselves as and how others perceive them by defining their Traits, Passions, Goals, and Devotions. Jump to <strong>Chapter 9: Social.</strong></p><h1>11. BUY EQUIPMENT</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> Every character starts with a kit of gear, which has a list of per purchased starting gear as well as an extra bit of starting cash they you can spend on additional things. Proceed to <strong>Chapter 11: Equipment</strong> for a full list of available kits and gear you can pick up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You may also cash in any left over CrP for sp at 1 CrP for 10 sc, but you don’t have to. You can save your CrP to spend later at your level up.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After purchasing your equipment, adjust your Encumbrance. Don’t forget that armor and shields will also modify this.</p><h1>12. TRANSFER TO CHARACTER SHEET</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Congratulations: you’re on the home stretch! Finish your character off by transferring your notes to a fresh character sheet, an example of which, with a break down, is found in <strong>Chapter 6: Character Vitals.</strong> You can also find a download for the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L8hQ38ZjLbn9E_CDqVb6_rKG-uG_5yGX/view">character sheet here.</a></p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class="sidebarTitle">Exploding Dice</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You’ll notice a exclamation mark (!) behind a lot of dice notations. This marks the dice as exploding, which means that should the maximum of that dice is rolled, you get to roll it again, this time with a - 1, and add what you rolled to the total.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> This continues for as long as you roll the maximum dice, however, the - 1 always stays a -1 one. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, if you roll a 3d8! for damage, you get a 5, 8, 8. Since you rolled the maximum value on two of your dice, you roll those dice again, and roll an 8, and 5, giving you a subtotal of 32 ( 5 + 8 + 8 + 8 - 1 + 5 - 1 ) but since you rolled another 8, you get to roll that dice again, and you get a 1, netting you a 0 ( 1 - 1 ).</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> There are two things you should be aware of: 1d100! explode to a 1d20!, while 1d20! explode to a d6!.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The second thing is that explosion dice don’t add additional dice to the number. So, in the example above, all that damage is only counted as having been done with 3 dice (instead of the 5 that were actually rolled).</p></td></tr></table><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class="sidebarTitle">Dice Size Hierarchy</h2></th></tr><tr><td><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Bonfire plays around a lot with dice sizes, so it’s important to know what dice to grab in those cases.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Dice sizes go as follows:</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> d2 → d3 → d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12 → d20</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If a d4 is exploding and drops to a d3 or lower, it stops exploding.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> If the dice size increases past a d20, you’ll add an extra dice starting at a d4. Further dice sizes will increase this smaller dice. This can continue ad nauseum, but no matter how many dice there are, they’re always considered to be rolled on 1 dice.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> So, 3d20! + d10! is still considered 1 dice.</p></td></tr></table><h5>Stat Scores</h5><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Stat Scores represent different dimensions of your character and how good their baseline is at certain activities. These dimensions are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intellect, Wisdom, Charisma.</p><h1>STAT CHECKS</h1><p style="margin:0px;"> There many come a time where a Skill Check doesn’t exactly cover what needs to be tested. What skill covers trying to deadlift a boulder or remember a fact about a person? When skills fail and it’s simply a raw test of an ability, Stat Checks come into play. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Players making an unopposed ability check roll a d20 and try to get a result equal to or under their their stat score. If the check is made at 1/2 the score, they're trying to roll equal to or under their score, rounded down. Should they do so, they succeed.</p><h3>OPPOSED CHECKS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Opposed checks work almost the same. The player rolls a d20! + their relevant stat score vs an opposing d20! + any relevant modifiers (such as the boulder being really heavy or only their foes relevant stat score). The person with the higher total succeeds.</p><h1>STRENGTH</h1><table style="width:240px;border-collapse: collapse;margin-bottom:10px"><tr><th colspan="5" style="column-span: all;background: #990000;text-align: left;color: whitesmoke;">Strength </th></tr><tr style="background: #222;color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;"><td>Score</td><td>Damage</td><td>Carry</td><td>Skill</td><td>Social</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>1</td><td>-4</td><td>1S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>2</td><td>-3</td><td>2S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>3</td><td>-3</td><td>1M</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>4</td><td>-3</td><td>1M 1S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>5</td><td>-2</td><td>1M 2S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>6</td><td>-2</td><td>2M</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>7</td><td>-1</td><td>2M 1S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>8</td><td>-1</td><td>2M 2S</td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>9</td><td>-1</td><td>1L</td><td>1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>1L</td><td>1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>1L</td><td>1</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>1L 1S</td><td>1</td><td>D4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>13</td><td>1</td><td>1L 2S</td><td>1</td><td>D4!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>1L 1M</td><td>2</td><td>D6!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>15</td><td>2</td><td>1L 1M 1S</td><td>2</td><td>D6!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>1L 1M 2S</td><td>2</td><td>D8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>17</td><td>3</td><td>1L 2M</td><td>2</td><td>D8!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>18</td><td>3</td><td>1L 2M 1S</td><td>2</td><td>D10!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;"><td>19</td><td>3</td><td>1L 2M 2S</td><td>3</td><td>D12!</td></tr><tr style="text-align: center;background: #ababab;"><td>20</td><td>4</td><td>2L</td><td>3</td><td>D20!</td></tr><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Strength (Str) represents your character’s pure brawn. How much can she lift and carry? How strong are her punches?</p><h3>DAMAGE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number is added to your damage whenever your character hits something with their fits or uses thrown ranged weapons. It’s the raw, physical force he can put into an object.</p><h3>CARRY</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number represents the number of items a character can carry in their hands before he gets more Encumbered. More on Encumbrance is found in <strong>Chapter 11: Equipment.</strong></p><h3>SKILL</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number represents the discount you apply to Skill costs whenever you buy a Skill with this as a listed Stat.</p><h3>SOCIAL DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sometimes your character’s strength can play into social situations, such as trying to intimidate your opponent.

Can she dodge arrows or can she execute a graceful pirouette? Dexterity is crucial for avoiding blows in combat or traps in a hallway.</p><h3>ATTACK</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Being graceful allows your character to take advantage of openings others can’t. This number gets added to all attack rolls your character makes.</p><h3>DEFENCE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> If you can move quicker than your opponent, you can often get out of harm’s way before it becomes a problem. This number gets added to all melee defense rolls your character makes.</p><h3>INITIATIVE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Another bonus of being quick on your feet is the ability to get moving quicker when manure hits the windmill. This number gets added to your initiative rolls at the beginning of combat.</p><h3>SKILL</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> This number represents the discount you apply to Skill costs whenever you buy a Skill with this as a listed Stat.</p><h3>SOCIAL DIE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Sometimes your character’s dexterity can play into social situations, such as trying to seduce your opponent.

Can he shrug off the Dancing Death or does he succumb to a head cold? Can she take a solid blow in combat and not even blink? These are the things Constitution oversees.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Constitution is the base of your starting Vitality so don’t neglect it.</p><h3>MIN VITALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Every other level, a character gains a reroll of their Vitality Die.

The Painted World was mutable and the source of all magic and there the First Children lived happily, beautiful, skilled, and perfect in everyway.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> They were the delight of all the Divines, save one: the trickster Divine, Rostam. Rostam quickly grew bored of the First Children and the constant fawning they received from the Divines.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> And so, under the guise of creating servants for the Divines, he created the Dwarves. He made the opposite of the First Children - crude, mean, ugly, and incorrigible in the extreme. They caused such an uproar in the Higher Realm that the Divines banished them to the Nothing beyond the Gate of Heaven, where certain death awaited them in the embrace of non-existent nothing.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The Father of the Dwarves took his people and before passing through the Gate of Heaven, slew the giant Ymir, who stood guard there and tossed his body into the Nothing. The All-Father and his sons jumped from the Gate and onto Ymir and from his bones they made the Middle Realm; the giant’s blood, the oceans and his muscles, the earth.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> There they lived a profane life, in defiance of the Divines. With the protection of the Bones of Ymir, the dwarves were able to avoid the direct displeasure of the Divines and so the Divines needed to think of different ways to reach them in their holds.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> They created the Bonfire, links to the Higher Realm, through which they sent the unthinking evils of the world through but the dwarves repulsed them.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> And so they created their Second Children, avenging angels robed in flesh, to travel through the Bonfires and war with the dwarves.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> But after centuries of war, the Second Children changed: they became obsessed with the total destruction of the dwarves and so they chained themselves to the Bonfires, harnessing the Divine against its wills. They became the orcs.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Appalled at what their Children had become, the Divines sent their First Children to bring the orcs back into the fold, but the orcs rebelled, sacrificing some of the First Children on the Bonfires and thus was born the human race.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Centuries have passed and the Middle Realm changes those that walk there. The First Children eventually called it home and became the elves.</p><h1>WHICH RACE SHOULD I CHOOSE?</h1><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Your race effects character creation in 3 ways: Stat Score Modifiers, Gameplay Rewards, and Archetype Costs. If you're new to RPGs in generally, go for a race that interests you based on the flavor.</p><h3>STAT SCORE MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> These modify the base stats that you roll. You can use it to balance out your character's weak spots or you can use it to maximize what your character is already good it. We recommend the latter as Bonfire is a game built around teamwork: you'll have friends who will be good at things your character isn't.</p><h3>GAMEPLAY REWARDS</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Each race is meant to encourage a certain type of play. For instance, orcs gain bonuses for starting things, like combats or social conflicts, so they reward players who are aggressive, while elves get rewarded for being careful with how they engage with others. These are noted under the Racial Temperament section in their summary. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Some races can spend less time mastering things than others, freeing up time (CrP) to focus on other pursuits or becoming true masters of their vocation. This is reflected in the Archetype Costs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> You'll notice that some races will have Archetype Exceptions: these are based on the lore of that race for the Middle Realm, the official campaign setting of Bonfire. GMs should feel free to modify these prices. Actually, GMs should modify any prices to fit their setting.</p><h1>RACIAL PREFERENCES</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Racial tensions exist in the Middle Realm and there’s bad blood between the different species, plus, some races get on other's nerves because of differing temperaments.

The elf, realizing that this is going to be harder than it needs to be because of the orcs bullheadedness and general lack of forethought, goes to the his human friend and tries to get him to sign on. Because humans like elves, the elf would get a d6! to convince him instead. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Orcs treat their own kin as Preferred for Racial Preferences.</p><h1>CHANGELINGS</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Changeling Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> -4 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +2 Dex</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> +3 Wis</p><p style="margin:0px;">Small Sized (- 1 ft to Measure, +3 to Melee & Ranged Defense, less movement, and require less food)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 10</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Crafty</p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 20</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Caster: 15<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 15</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 25</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Changelings are strange little beings. The rumors are that their demons who've trade places with human children left out in the wild or that they're the stillborn children of wizards and witches. Either way, their wiliness and techincal prowess make them welcome guests where every they end up. </p><h3>HISTORY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Changelings were said to first appear in the employ of hedge wizards and witches in the hinterlands of the Rhon mountains. They were usually attached to a village, where they worked as tinkers and menders, or as helpers in workshops. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> During the spread of the First Empire, many officials specifically went out and drafted them, recruiting them as armours, sappers, or magic-users in the army or household artists, as they had a keen artistic eye and creative spirit. They formed their own communities and many bought their freedom, seeking their own way in the world but many stayed as it was a good gig. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> As the First Empire fell, many changelings simply integrated into the local culture. Those that didn't often found themselves the target of persecution, accused of being traitors to the Empire or simply scapegoated for their unwillingness to give up their culture. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> With the rise of the Second Empire, they have, however, once again found a safe place in the machinary of state, but many still long for the quiet life in a tucked away community where they can tinker and mend away. </p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Changelings are about the size of a 10 year old human, with extremely pale skin, unsually long fingers and large eyes. Besides this, they appear like little humans, with whispy hair on their head and face. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They dress in whatever the area custom is but tend towards bright and clashing colors. </p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Changelings are wily and crafty, and, while not lacking in morality, tend to get caught up on whatever project they're currently on. They enjoy puzzles more than anything - the thrill of having everything click into place just perfectly is the finest thing a person can experiance. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They also tend to be on the shy side, as much as possible, keeping out of the limelight. Worldly power and accolades hold little appeal for them, but there is a sense of wanting to be apart something greater than keeps them reaching out to the outside world. </p><h1>DWARVES</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Dwarf Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> -3 Dex</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +4 Con</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> -2 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Small Sized (- 1 ft to Measure, +3 to Melee & Ranged Defense, less movement, and require less food)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 20</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Unconquerable</p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 15<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 35</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Caster: n/a<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 25</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 10</strong></p><h3>Archetype Exceptions</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Paragon Acolyte: 20</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Symbolist: 20</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Dwarves are called the 'Stonemen' not because they're made of stone but because they're hard as rock. They're obstinate and incorrigible and, as a rule, they never do anything that someone else wants them to do. As such, they're the most disagreeable beings in the Middle Realm. They're also the most straightforward, brave, and loyal beings as well. </p><h3>HISTORY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Dwarves were made by the Divine Rostam for one purpose: to try and get the other Divines to stop huffing their own farts and realize their not infalible. As such, he took their favorite children, those beings that would become the elves, and flipped them on their head. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Needless to say, when these little buggers became running around the Higher World, the other Divines were not amused and quickly tried to get rid of them by banishing them to the Void. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Well, the dwarves were not going to be beaten so easily. After all, any one could be sentenced to non-existance by being throwing into the endless Nothing. So, they slew the guardian, Ymir, and threw his body into the Nothing and thus created the Middle Realm. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> The rest of dwarven history is filled with the Divine's futile attempts to scrub them from the world but finally as the gods began to relax and realize how much they overracted, the Dwarves soon found themselves fighting amongst themselves. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Currently, they've ditched their isolation policy and have begun to interact with the outside world. </p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Dwarves are the opposite of elves. They're short, barrel chested with thick hair growing all over their bodies. This hair ranges from coal black to a golden hue, depending on which hold the dwarf hails from. They also always support big bushy beards that are near hard as steel. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> These beards are their pride and joy and they take great care in them. Woven into each beard is the tale of that dwarf's life and accomplishments as well as their job within the hold. You can learn a lot from reading a dwarf's beard. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Besides this and their tools, the dwarves really don't take care of themselves, eschewing anything showy or fancy, like nice fabrics or baths. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Dwarf anatomy is, thankfully, a mystery to most outsiders. All dwarves, to other races, appear human and use human pronouns, though in dwarvish, their are no pronouns because that's more bothersome. There is a rumor that their are female dwarves but that there's 0 sexual dimorphism in the species, which makes courting a very careful affair, but the running theory is that female dwarves are just anvils. </p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> As stated before, dwarves are subborn. They're very rarely, however, psychopathically so. More often, once they have decided something, they tend to get defencive and refuse to relent unless they absolutely have to. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> This makes dwarven governments and social structures very slow moving and difficult to work with but, it also means that if you get a dwarf to agree with you, they will happily die on that hill. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> In fact, the only time that a dwarf seems to be happy is when he's being stubborn about something. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Finally, dwarves do not ascribe to social niceties. It's not that they're incapabile to understanding them or aware of them: they just don't think they're worth paying attention to, in the same way that most people don't notice insects. </p><h1>ELVES</h1><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Elf Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> -2 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -4 Con</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +4 Int</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> +2 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Medium Sized</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 10</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Patient</p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 15<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 15</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Caster: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 10</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 20</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> The Elves are the first born of the Divines. Originally, the inhabitants of the Painted World, the source of all magic, they now inhabit the Middle Realm as mentally ethereal beings.</p><h3>HISTORY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> After the corruption of the Orcs, the Divines sought another means of assailing the Dwarves in their holds. They turned to the First Children, the Elves.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, they marshaled the elven forces and invaded the Middle Realm.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The invasion proved more fruitful than the first one. The Elves’ ethereal nature allowed them to interact with the Middle Realm without being corrupted by it and their corporeal bodies allowed them to wage war on the Dwarves on their own terms.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> But there were side effects of their new environment. The Elves, who used to be nearest to the Divines, found that they were now less connected to their creators. With all that reality in the way, their prayers had a harder time of reaching the Divines.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> After generations, the Elves have become dispersed, their common cause mostly forgotten and their heritage lost to the mists of time. Some continue the war, but most of them have integrated into the societies of the Middle Realm as artisans, scholars, and wizards.</p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Elves are slender beings that are widely considered classically beautiful, though many find their features alien and off putting. They uniformly have long ears that taper to a point at the end.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> Their eyes are pure white, with no iris or pupil visible, this matched with their sharp teeth, can give them a feline turn to their face.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Elves naturally survive off the ebb and flow of magic that drifts through the air of the Painted World. While still present in the Middle Realm, these winds are a sliver of their natural magnitude and so Elves need to find other sources; the main one being through the magic inherent in all living creatures. While vegetables do have magic in them, an Elf would have to consume 100s of pounds of lettuce each day to not die of starvation. The only realistic way of getting enough magic to survive is through the consumption of raw meat. </p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> To describe an Elf as “careful” would be a huge understatement. They tend to live longer than other races, not because some supernaturally long lifespan, but because they're always careful about their actions. They see other races as brash and impetuous while they're in turn seen as slow and cowardly. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> It's not they're incapable of great emotion or quick action but elves seem to understand that with every action comes a consquence, whether that action was well meaning or not, and that this karmic force is more powerful than any other law or power. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> However, once set on a course, it is hard to dissaude an elf, for they do nothing lightly.</p><h1>GAUNTS</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Gaunt Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> -2 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +2 Dex</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -3 Con</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -3 Int</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +2 Wis</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> +3 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Medium Sized</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 10</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Salvation Secured</p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 35</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Caster: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 10</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 10</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Gaunts are said to be depraved creatures stuck between life and death. They love filthy lucre more than what made them human. They're those that, for whatever reason, have sold part of their souls for either money or at a change at eternal life in the world to come. </p><h3>HISTORY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> During the last days of the Old Vyatichi Kingdom, those with the power sought a way to cheat death and become immortal. While they didn't find the cure, they found a bandage: soul shiving, the process of grafting a piece of another's soul onto one's own to prolong your life. The priests and shamans talked about the gift they would give those who did this: how a piece of their soul would travel with them to heaven after death, granting even the vilest sinner reprieve. They also offered a hefty pay bonus too. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> And thus the first gaunts were born as the husks of those that sought a shortcut to salvation. Once the Empire took over, they outlawed the practices but it couldn't be undone, not the ritual or the knowledge and certain government officials also partook until it was an open secret. Many became man servants or thralls to these officials, pulled by some invisible thread together. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Crack downs by the Orthodoxy, both on practioners and gaunts themselves took place, with many going into hiding while others were rounded up into ghettoes. Many were burned at the stake during the last years of the Empire. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Not that the gaunts seemed to care. With salvation in the next world secured, most lived riot, indulging in the most depraved and headless way possible. Forming gangs and joining outcasts, becoming actors, and living life as if every day was their last. This, along with the church's indictment, only further estranged them from society. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And so on the edges of those societies they live, for the most part. Joining acting troopes or sellsword companies and generally making their way in the world where they can find a place to live out their final mortal days. </p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Gaunts of all races look generally the same as the soul shiving process drains them of their vitality. Their skin turns ghost white, their hair a weak grey, and their eyes become milky as if they're blind. Their bodies becoming desiccated, thin and reedy. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> They still need to eat, drink, and do other bodily functions - they are, even after all that, living. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Gaunts tend to dress in flamboyent clothing that is a mix and match of whatever they kind find. Most say this is because they loot the clothing off of those they kill but it's more likely because they just wear what they can find or because they wish to make up for their dull color palette </p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> As stated, gaunts get a bad rep for being wholely without morals but that's not always the case. Some have undergone the process because they need to feed thier families or out of a powerful sense of devotion or religious zeal so actually gaunts run the spectrum of personality types: they're just saddled with their reputation because of an admittedly not small section of them. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> What makes up the gaunt's personality is why he made the sacrifice to do what he did. Why was so precious to him that he would make such a huge sacrifice for? That's a complicated question and not easy to answer by the gaunt player should have their answer before play begins. </p><h1>HUMANS</h1><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Human Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;">Medium Sized</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 15</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">We all have our theories on what personality traits that are shared by the human race and I'm not interested in wading in on that debate so instead of having a Racial Temperament, Humans increase their Honor Dice by 1 size. </p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 10</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Caster: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 10</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 10</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Humans are the first natives of the Middle Realm.

Orc warlords discovered they could strengthen and corrupt the Bonfires by burning Elves alive in the its flame.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> But out of the remains rose new life: a creature of both heaven and earth.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> These children of the Middle Realm survived by forming clans in the hills and mountains, away from the fighting, and there they began to thrive.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The turning point in their civilization was when the Divines discovered their unique connection with the Humans. Each Human carried a Bonfire inside them, making them perfect vessels for the favor of the gods. The Divines began focusing their attention on them and bestowing their gifts on their adopted children.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Humans have now become the preeminent race in the Middle Realm, with kingdoms and empires across the world.</p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> The Humans of the Middle Realm look like you and me.

Through the Bonfire they've formed a New Covenant with the Divines, remaking their minds in their image. They were the founders of the First Empire and their legacy is still cleaved to by the kings of the age. </p><h3>HISTORY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> The rise of the minotaurs trace their origin back to the Sack of Um Badr, an event that, at the time only mattered to the Beja, but would have world changing consquences. Details are sketchy since beastmen are barbaric and don't keep records but the story goes that using the Bonfire in the city, the minotaurs were able to forge a New Covenant with the Divines, granting them almost human intelligence. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> From there, the minotaurs organized themselves together and swept through the Rhon, subjegating the tribes there, overrunning the dwarven hold and learning all that they could. And like that, the First Empire was born. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Like an unstoppable tide, it conquered most of the known world - bringing all under one banner. And so there was an age of peace undreamed off. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> But it wouldn't last: minotaurs, while inspired warriors and generals, have no real strong talent for statecraft. Religious revivials, both at home and abroad caused cultural and population shifts that destablized the government. Rich merchants were soon flexing their power over officials, with wanton corruption investing all levels. It was all too much and the Empire cracked and fell apart. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Now there are minotaur kingdoms dotted the land, powerful but small states, but most make there way in other's lands. Still, there legacy lives on with their symbols still used by burgeoning states, event those founded by their traditional enemies. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> But, alas, the new Empire that now conqueres only pays lip service to them and is founded by humans who seek to be associated with bygone ages. </p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Minotaurs are huge creatures that are half man and half bull. Specifically, the head and upper torse, as well as the legs are bull, while the chest, shoulders, and arms are those of a man. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Both male and female are larger than the average person, with males standing on average about 7 ft tall and the woman standing at around 6 ft tall. Males sprout horns, though they lack the strength to effectively gore with them like their bull counterparts. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Their skin color, as well as their fur color and pattern, vary by region, with traditionall tanner skinned minotaurs coming from the south and light skinned ones coming from the north but during the days of the First Empire there was so much population movement that this is a trend rather than a rule. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Note that Minotaurs are more closely related to Beastfolk than they are to cows and so are, in fact, carnivorous. </p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Minotaurs cut royal figures and their personalities match. They have an extreme sense of pride and a great depth of feeling in accordance with their beastial nature. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> They're extremely devoted to whatever cause they throw their weight behind and there is no difference to them between their opinions and themselves, making them very cocksure. This can, unsurprisingly, make them bullies as they care little for other's opinions about things. </p><h1>ORCS</h1><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Orc Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> +4 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +3 Con</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -4 Int</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> -4 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Medium Sized</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 15</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Aggressive</p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 20<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 25</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Caster: 20<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 30</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 10</strong></p><h3>Archetype Exceptions</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Priest: n/a: Shaman: 20</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Avenging angels who know how to make war like others know how to breathe.

If it doesn’t allow them to get a leg up on their enemy, why bother with it?</p><p style="margin:0px;"> The issue is that they don’t really have common sense: if it doesn’t directly relate to warfare, they don’t see the benefit.</p><p style="margin:0px;"> So, weapons and armor, sure, but growing food? I don’t see how it gives me the leg up. Let others do it and I’ll just raid them for theirs.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Orcs aren’t that much dumber than the average person but their brains tend to overheat when thinking about complex topics.</p><h1>RATFOLK</h1><p>🜂 Advanced Rule</p><table style="border: 3px solid #b45f06;padding: 10px;margin:0px 0px 5px"><tr><th><h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Ratfolk Summary</h2></th></tr><tr><td><h3>MODIFIERS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> -6 Str</p><p style="margin:0px;"> -4 Con</p><p style="margin:0px;"> +3 Wis</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> +5 Cha</p><p style="margin:0px;">Small Sized (- 1 ft to Measure, +3 to Melee & Ranged Defense, less movement, and require less food)</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Vitality Size Modifier is 10</p><h3>RACIAL TEMPERAMENT</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Helpful</p><h3>ARCHETYPE COSTS</h3><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Expert: 10<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Servant: 20</strong></p><p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Caster: 15<p style="margin:0px;"><strong>Socialite: 15</strong></p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Fighter: 25</strong></p><h3>Archetype Exceptions</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"><strong>Noble: 40</strong></p></td></tr></table><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Ratfolk are social creatures. They love people and being around people. Others find them pleasant to be around. As such, Ratfolk can be found as diplomats, traders, and minstrals. </p><h3>HISTORY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> Ratfolk were the result of advanced Bejaian magics. After the Gothic and Capatian rebels, a spirit of fear riot in the city-states that a similar uprising might quickly come so the need for loyal servants inspired some of the greatest magic-users of the age to begin work on creating a race of people specifically made to be amenable. Thus, the first ratfolk. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> Under the Empire, ratfolk came into high demand and those the Beja were secretive with their secrets, they were happy to swap them for coin and thus the creatures spread all over the continent, mainly as house servants. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> They eventually became extremely well known for making excellent spies and were called in to defuse hostile situations, as if they radianted an innate calming aura. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> But magic is wily and it soon became clear that the ratfolk were cunning, desiring more out of life than just to play second fiddle to others and so they sold their skills to the dwarven holds and enemies of the Empire to gain their freedom and a level of automony. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> And so the last Primarch of the Empire fell by ratfolk hands, putting the last nail in the coffin. </p><h3>APPEARANCE</h3><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;"> Ratfolk are smaller and slimmer than other races, with lithe, fur covered bodies that range from auburn to dark black. They have beady eyes and long tails. For the most part, they appear like their smaller cousins, though with lighter frames and opposible thumbs. </p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p style="margin:0px;"> As stated, ratfolk are people people. They're extremely social and, as a rule, are extroverted. They tend to be agreeable and try to get along with everyone but this shouldn't be taken as people pleasing or weak because ratfolk are clever - dangerously so. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> People tend to think that because ratfolk are so easy going that they're push overs and that they can be taken advantage of but ratfolk sees it as "I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine" kind of deal so they're not just going to do things to do things. They very much believe in the social contract, but their animal nature makes them ruthless as some points. </p><p style="margin:0px;"> In fact, ratfolk can be quite ruthless to those they deem outside their pack, which has earned them some reputation as having a herd mentality. For ratfolk the only war is total war. </p>    </div><script src="js/script.js"></script></body></html>
