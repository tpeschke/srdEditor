|1Introduction|lArchetypes represent your character’s background training and starting skills and there are two types of Archetypes: Generalist and Specialist.|1Generalist Archetypes|pThese Archetypes represent the overall theme.|lFor instance, Fighter Archetypes tend to be good at things related to combat. So, if you’re looking to make a combat focused character, you can look there. They are Expert, Weird-Adept, Servant, Socialite, and Fighter. You must pick two starting out.|lGeneralists will have a wide variety of discounts within their theme that are good for just getting straight bonuses.|2Purchasing Archetypes|lFirst choose a Generalist Primary and a Generalist Secondary Archetype and pay the price in CrP for both based on your race.|lYou use the Vitality Die, the Skills & Trainings, and the Primary Drawback sections from the Primary, and combine both Archetype Abilities sections, though you remove 1 leveling ability from your Secondary Archetype, unless you Double Specialize.|pAll Generalists, except for the Servant, can be selected as both your Primary and Secondary Archetype, called Double Specializing. So, you can be a Fighter/Fighter but not a Servant/Servant.|lThe benefits for double specializing will be noted at the end of the Archetype.|lIf two characters have the same ability, unless it says otherwise, those abilities stack.|1Specialist Archetypes|pThese represent a more focused version of the Generalist Archetypes.|lThey’re more expensive but come with additional powers. When you purchase a Specialist Archetype, it replaces the Generalist Archetype of the same type. So, for instance, if you’re an Expert, you can replace it with the Ranger or the Thief.|2Purchasing Specialist Archetypes|pAt 1st level and at every level up, you can purchase a Specialist Archetype which replaces your Generalist Archetypes. If at 1st level, see the Specialist Archetypes at 1st Level sidebar below.|pYou can replace one or both at each level, in either order, barring double-down Weird-Adepts who have to specialize both at the same time into the same Specialist Archetype.|lYou can also choose to replace neither if it doesn’t fit your character because once you purchase a Specialist Archetype, you are stuck with it.|lSpecialist Archetypes completely replaces everything from the Generalist Archetype they’re replacing though it doesn’t retroactively remove things you’ve already rolled for or free purchases.|lSo, a Fighter, with a d10 Vitality Die decides, at level 4 to become a Soldier with a Vitality Die of a d8. He doesn’t then reroll all his Vitality Die - from that point forward, he simply uses the d8 instead.|lYou’ll pay an additional 20 CrP for each one you’re replacing regardless.|lYour GM may choose to reject an Archetype combination based on the fact that the two Archetypes don’t fit together thematically. So, while a Thief/Priest (Beast Covenant) might be really powerful because of the Beast Covenant’s Shape Changing ability, if there’s not a Patron of Thieves and Animals in the campaign world, you’re out of luck.|lRemember that if you’re replacing your Secondary Archetype, you’ll still need to select a leveling ability from your new Archetype to remove.|
