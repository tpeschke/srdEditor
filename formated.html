    <p>Combat is not simply about who can do the most damage the quickest. Battles, at their heart, are manifestations
        of the fever of conflict going on between the two sides. This is why sometimes a small, untrained force of
        zealots can overcome a larger professional army.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of combat, if at least one side has a captain, a Confrontation is also started with the two
        opposing sides are the two opposing forces (the players vs the goblins, for example).</p>

    <p>This runs like a normal Confrontation except the company captains are in charge and get to dictate pretty much
        everything. So as the battle progresses, the captains are going to run the Confrontation in parallel with it,
        trying to swing the battlefield to their advantage.</p>

    <p>Unlike a regular Confrontation, however, it is not about gaining points but about who wins or loses that round.

    <p>If you win the Confrontation round, the target behaves the way you want. This represents either them being too
        panicked or not having enough information to make a good decision, or effective leadership and a clear grasp of
        what’s going on.</p>

    <p>During combat, a captain can, at any time, state that they want a fighter (or group of fighters) to perform an
        action or behave in a certain way. </p>
</div>
<div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ForinstancehsWUbvKASV'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>For instance, the captain might want a fighter to switch his Tactic to be more aggressive, or swap who he’s
        aiming for. </p>
</div>
<div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

    <p>He can also do this for enemy fighters: the only exception is they can’t make them run away (which can happen but
        we'll talk about that a bit later).</p>

    <p>So, for example, you’re the company captain and you’re trying to convince the enemy goblin that he should try and
        get at your company’s ranger but currently he’s making a beeline for your fighter. In that case, you can use the
        fighter’s Characteristic “You Don’t Want to Mess With Me” to make an Appeal to get the goblin to second guess
        himself and go after your ranger.</p>

    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'AcaptaincanRgMbdDTZLn'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>A captain can affect any number of fighters, however, they need to be easily “grouped”: there needs to be a good
        reason why every fighter “targeted” would be affected by the same Appeal.</p>

    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'TheCaptaincapeHwDkUiPe'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>

        round.</p>

    <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>FIELD PROMOTIONS & NO CHARISMA </strong>There might be the case a captain dies and a lieutenant is suddenly promoted, however the chain of command should
        have been determined beforehand.</p>

    <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'Ifthatmeanssqplaiwlrz'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
    <p>If that means the new captain has no Charisma or other skills, they’ll use their Warfare skill rounded up (so a
        d4! by default). So, it's better than nothing because it keeps people from just running for it and they gain
        less Stress but still not great.</p>

        goblins).</p>

    <p>If one side has a captain but they're removed from combat for any reason (including going unconscious) with no
        replacement, everyone on their side immediately has their Panic Threshold lowered by 1 Wound Category, so keep
        the company captain safe!</p>

    <p>A side with no captain can’t actively go “on the attack”, meaning that they can no longer initiate a
        Confrontation round but only defend against them. </p>

    <p>So, for goblins, having no warfare, no charisma, or no intelligence, they would auto-fail but if you’re facing an
        ettin and try to intimidate him based on strength, he would roll his strength dice (and maybe some of things
        because he's a big boy who can really hurt you).</p>

    <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>RUNNING AWAY </strong>Normally, running away is only caused by a fighter reaching their Stress Threshold, but, with no captain, any
