        they have lost.</p>

    <p>If a Mental Break happens as part of a Confrontation, the opposing side gets to decide what form the Mental Break
        takes. For combat, that might entail the person running for it or throwing down their weapons and attempting to
        surrender but it might also entail them turning their allies. For non-combat scenarios, it generally results in
        the person just giving in to what you want.</p>
