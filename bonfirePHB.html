        <p>Welcome to Bonfire Character Creation! You'll notice that there's a lot of steps and, if you're familiar with
          other TTRPGs, that it's a bit longer and a bit more complicated than other games. Why is that?</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='ThefirstistYctbjrgcHJ' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThefirstistYctbjrgcHJ'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>The first is that it gives you, the player, more choice. Do you want to build a cunning fighter than actually
          using their brains instead of their brawns to defeat others? Do you want to play a sly diplomat that crushes
          her
          opponents' morale without even lifting a finger? Or perhaps you want to play a power wizard that concocts his
          spells on the fly, building the perfect one for each scenario?</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='MoreimportantaZYFBgElzV' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'MoreimportantaZYFBgElzV'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>More importantly, do you want those different characters to actually feel different when you play them? So
          that
          convincing some actually feels different than just beating them to death?</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThisisthefiaOLeMraqZl'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>This is the first thing that Bonfire offers you.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThesecondthixhPLKHjxwH'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>The second thing is that it allows you to be surprised during creation: through your choices and rolls,
          you'll
          get a more fully formed character than in other systems. You'll get what you want with extra twists that help
          add interest and depth to your character that you wouldn't get in other systems.</p>
      </div>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'AndnotonlytCvzogkonIj'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>And not only that, but you'll also have those choices, twists, and depth mean something in play. Is your
          character brash? You'll be rewarded for playing that way in the game.</p>

        <p>Your character has 6 attributes that define your character physically and mentally. These are Strength (Str),

        <p>Dexterity (Dex) is a measure of how agile your character is. Can she dodge arrows, or can she execute a
          graceful
          pirouette? Dexterity is crucial for avoiding blows in combat or traps in a hallway.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ConstitutionWhRvpLlkSH'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Constitution (Con) represents your character’s overall health and toughness. Can he shrug off the Dancing
          Death
          or does he succumb to a head cold? Can she take a solid blow in combat and not even blink? These are the
          things

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'IntellectIntRMdlEahKEl'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Intellect (Int) measures your character’s raw knowledge: how much data can he remember? Can she do
          mathematical
          calculations or remember who the Elector of Stanitz is? Intellect doesn’t help in applying that knowledge, but
          it does give you knowledge to draw on.</p>

        <p>Willpower (Will) is applied knowledge. Does she process information quicker and learn from other’s mistakes?
          Does
          he understand life is more than just a set of numbers of probabilities? Can she see other’s viewpoints? How
          well

        <p>Presence (Pre) represents force of personality. Does he bend others to his will? Is she the focus of any room
          she
          enters? Do people look up to them or what to be him? Presence is not looks or even likeability: it represents
          this animal magnetism that people follow.</p>

        <p>Presence covers how much bonus Favor you get when worshipping the Divines, your starting Honor, how strong

        <p>Bonfire is specifically balanced for you to roll 3d6 in order, with 10 being the average result but don't
          worry
          about feeling like you have low scores or they're not in the order you want: you'll have a chance to rearrange

        <p>In Bonfire, you'll almost always be weaker than your opponent: what makes a hero is not supernatural
          abilities,
          but the simple fact that he fights longer and harder for what he believes in than other men.</p>

        <p>Alright, you have your scores. Now it’s time to determine how many Creation Points (or CrP, for short) you’ll
          start with. These CrP will be spent on modifying your character, buying them their skills and increasing their
          Scores. They may also be spent on rerolls at certain steps.</p>

        <p>Even still, you may want to switch your stats around. This may be because you have almost the right stats,
          but
          you have a specific character concept in mind. For instance, using the example stats in Step 1, your party may
          need a diplomatic character more than a strong character. In this case, it would really help to swap Strength
          and Presence.</p>

          <p>Thinking of Traits on the fly is hard. For new players, there's two ways of handling this:
            either picture a character from fiction you like or find interesting and try to describe them.
            These are their Traits, and you can crib off them to start with.</p>

          <p>Or if you have no idea where to start or are just a risk taker, you can use the Trait Generator,
            which will give you a random Trait. These Traits may not always make sense, but they can often
            serve as a jumping off point for your imagination.</p>

        <p> Elves naturally survive off the ebb and flow of magic that drifts through the air of the Painted
          World. While
          still present in the Middle Realm, these winds are a sliver of their natural magnitude and so
          Elves need to find
          other sources; the main one being through the magic inherent in all living creatures. While
          vegetables do have
          magic in them, an Elf would have to consume 100s of pounds of lettuce each day to not die of
          starvation. The
          only realistic way of getting enough magic to survive is through the consumption of raw meat.

        <p> To describe an Elf as “careful” would be a huge understatement. They tend to live longer than other
          races,
          not because some supernaturally long lifespan, but because they're always careful about their
          actions. They see
          other races as brash and impetuous while they're in turn seen as slow and cowardly.

        <p> It's not they're incapable of great emotion or quick action but elves seem to understand that with
          every action
          comes a consequence, whether that action was well meaning or not, and that this karmic force is more
          powerful than
          any other law or power.

        <p> An orc’s life is defined by struggle: from birth to death, they conceptualize the universe as having
          a vendetta against them. This can often give them a martyr complex and make them morose traveling
          companions at times because they feel the weight of the world.

          orcs would simply scoff at that.</p>

        <p> There’s nothing an orc values more than their honor and the chance to prove themselves against a
          worthy foe. This is often seen in their deities across orcish cultures, which are almost exclusively
          pantheons of their greatest foes. It is taken for granted that you are only as good as your enemies.

            together thematically. So, while a Thief/Priest (Beast Covenant) might be really powerful because of the Beast
            Covenant’s Shape Changing ability, if there’s not a Patron of Thieves and Animals in the campaign world, you’re

        <p><strong>Baby-sitting</strong> While an individual Cateran may

        <p> Whenever a person engaged with the Cateran tries to disengage, the Cateran gets an
          immediate free attack that,
          if it hits, deals half damage. This happens regardless of where they are on the

        <p><strong>Closed Openings</strong> Flanking is the art of
          dividing people’s attention and the
          Cateran has perfected that art. Anyone flanked by a Cateran lowers their attack
          die by 1 size, regardless of who
          they’re attacking.</p>

        <p><strong>Mutieren</strong> A Cateran knows to move their blade to
          get into places
          their opponents wouldn't expect. If facing an enemy whose weapon has a base
          Parry or who is carrying a shield,
          the Cateran receives a +1 to Attack +1 for every 2 levels they've obtained. This
          ability isn't effective against people
          who gained their Parry solely through training.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'4pjKgYmzzGBg'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p><strong>Shadowing</strong> By keeping close to their opponent,
          the Cateran can negate people’s defensive posturing. By taking 7 Stress, a
          Cateran can negate any bonuses an opponent gets from moving, whether that’s
          shifting, stepping back, or whatever and also stops their opponent from moving.

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'4pOTyYzRxmdu'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> The Cateran can do this as many times as they want but the Stress cost doubles each
          time they do so, though this resets once they’ve had time to destress. Also,
          this Stress cost is lowered by 1 for every 3 levels they’ve obtained, down to 3
          Stress.</p>

        <p><strong>Bum Rush</strong> A Cateran can also use his allies to
          more effectively flank their
          opponents. When flanking from the side, you and your allies lower your target’s
          defense die by 1,
          including
          the dice of those using shields (though they still get a chance to Parry). This
          doesn’t, however, give you any benefit for attacking from directly behind.</p>

          <p>A Cosmic Link is the specific celestial body that the Divine is associated with, and it usually gives an
            insight
            to the personality of the god. The Cosmic Link doesn’t necessarily mean your Patron is primarily the Divine
            of
            that Cosmic thing. So, a Divine associated with the moon might not be primarily a moon god, in the same way
            that
            while Venus was associated with the Morning Star, she was primarily viewed as a love goddess by the Romans.
            Still, your holy symbols may incorporate the moon motif commonly to represent her.</p>

        <p><strong>Rethink An Argument </strong>Advocates tend to be more
          introspective than other Socialites, which allows them to wait on an argument
          until they can articulate their thoughts more clearly. When making an Appeal,
          the Advocate can put aside a number of Ranks equal to 1 +
          their level. This dice isn't added to their total for points.</p>

        <p><strong>Flanking Point </strong>The Advocate can really use his
          unassuming nature to really hammer home a point. If multiple pieces of Evidence
          are presented in a round of a Confrontation, and the opposition picks yours to
          respond
          to, you gain an additional point.</p>

        <p><strong>Wallflower Bloom </strong>The Advocate really shines
          when not center stage. When making an Appeal, if you use a Trait with the lowest Rank (or are tied for it)
          and your side wins the round, gain an additional
          point.</p>

        <p><strong>Helper's Portion </strong>Sometimes the reward is just
          to know
          you've helped. When the person that started the Confrontation is dividing out
          the
          Honor, if the
          Advocate takes the least amount, they gain 1 Honor + 1 for every 5 levels
          they've obtained.</p>

          ability to get out of trouble and use that adrenaline that comes as death comes
          near to dodge the grim reaper and keep running. After the results are given,
          the Rascal can take 2 Stress to modify his results by 1. These may be done with
          the
          following conditions:</p>

        <p><strong>Vancian Shaping</strong> The Runegalder chains the power

        <p> Every 24 hours, the Runegalder can seal 3 spells. He can also bind an additional
          spell for every 3 levels he’s obtained. This means that he may cast those spells
          at any time by simply speaking the rune they’re linked to, once prepared.

        <p><strong>Grimoire</strong> This is the Runegalder’s spell book
          and keeps the spells that he binds to runes. Unlike a normal spell book,
          however, the spells are scribed in meteorite ink and blood that seals their
          magic power in the text itself. This means that the Runegalder’s Grimoire does
          the channeling latently for him.</p>

        <p>At first level he constructs 3 spells using his known Rudiments and an additional 1
          at level up. These spells can’t have a Drain greater than 7 + their level (so at
          1st level, his spells can only have a Drain of 8) when it is scribed into the

        <p class="italic"> So, a 2nd level Runegalder scribes a new spell. He can max out at 7
          Drain. He chooses to make it a Wall Shape (3 Drain), at Full Range (1 Drain),
          Near Origin (1 Drain) and for its Effect, he chooses Disorient (2 Drain), for a
          total of 7. He could have also made it Chain Shape instead for 1 Drain, and

        <p>Note that spells cast by the Runegalder only last their Interval unless their Effect
          is stacked, in which case, it either increases that Interval by a like amount or
          gains the Stacking bonus but not both. This is decided when the spell is cast.

        <p> Spells inscribed at different levels count as completely different spells and must
          be sealed to different runes. So, if the Runegalder has a 8 SP Flash Grenade and
          a 11 SP Flash Grenade, he would need two runes to cast both. He couldn’t simply
          bind “Flash Grenade” to one rune and then choose which he wanted to use in the

        <p>Every person has flaws; little quirks of their personality or odd behaviors. These flaws are often a way of
          dealing with troubles in their life, letting off Stress or rationalizing their behavior to others. Other times
          they’re artifacts of a hard life, like a soldier whose missing an arm.</p>

        <p>This basic training allows a character to more effectively utilize armor of different types based on their
          level
          of familiarity with them. It’s split into 3 categories:</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'Light15CrPBukXCvhqNi'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p><strong>Light (15 CrP)</strong> This covers armor that tends to not to restrict the wearer so is often
          favored by skill
          centric
          characters.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'Medium10CrPGWFBrreaOR'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p><strong>Medium (10 CrP)</strong> This armor is a bit heavier than Light armor and offers a tradeoff between
          protection and
          mobility.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='Heavy10CrPQmULEdAvMa' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'Heavy10CrPQmULEdAvMa'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p><strong>Heavy (10 CrP)</strong> The armor in this category is durable, thick, and heavy, able to withstand
          blows but at the
          cost
          of being hard to move in.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='YouhavetobueVZgEVdYJA' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'YouhavetobueVZgEVdYJA'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>You have to buy armor training in sequence, starting at Light and moving all the way to Heavy.</p>
      </div>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'YoucanalwaysTukcpYpJfx'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>You can always try and use armor without the baseline knowledge of how to properly wear and don it, but the
          Defense penalty is doubled and you're always considered Fatigued if that’s the case.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='YoucanfurtheojmpUoBYjM' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'YoucanfurtheojmpUoBYjM'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>You can further your training in armor to increase the benefits. See the Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced
          Training Sidebar for more details.</p>

      <div class="anchor">

        <p>For 10 CrP, this teaches a character the basic understanding of how to properly use and employ shields in
          combat.
          This training covers all types of shields.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <p>You can always try to use a shield without the training; however, you gain a -4 to your defense when doing
          so.
        </p>
      </div>

        <p>By gaining the basic understanding of how a weapon is wielded, used and taken care of, you not only expand
          its
          longevity, but also your longevity on the battlefield.</p>
      </div>

        <p>Weapon training costs 10 CrP and is taken for individual weapons, however its benefits extend to weapons of
          that
          share similar features.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

        <p>A person completely untrained in weapons both Attacks and Defends with that weapon using a d12!.</p>

      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='HoweveronetRXoxxvNyuk' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'HoweveronetRXoxxvNyuk'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>However, one trained uses a d20! Attack and Defense (depending on whether or not they use a shield).</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'AdditionallyJRTnxiuHCv'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Additionally, this is extended to any weapon that shares similar qualities.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='ForexampleaiDJuxxxjGe' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ForexampleaiDJuxxxjGe'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>For example, a character with training only in the Dusack extends that training to all melee weapons.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='AcharacterwiyAhNCZYXUP' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'AcharacterwiyAhNCZYXUP'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>A character with training in both a Melee and Ranged weapons, gains that training to all weapons.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='SowhywouldPPssnufBXB' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SowhywouldPPssnufBXB'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>So, why would you take training in multiple weapons once you have one melee and one ranged? Because this
          training
          allows you to further master that weapon, increasing its usefulness.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'WeaponShieldPLuhPAUuTX'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Trainings are further training in those particular fields, like the name
          implies. They can only be taken for things that you already have Basic Training in.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='EachoftheseWcoYvoeDNQ' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'EachoftheseWcoYvoeDNQ'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Each of these types of Training has two things: Tiers, which represent how broad your knowledge is (sort of
          like
          Suite Suites and Advanced Skills), and Ranks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='ForinstancezMYKUUPOYN' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ForinstancezMYKUUPOYN'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>For instance, the Tiers of Armor training are All Armor, Armor Type, and Specific Armor. So, if you could
          gain a
          bonus for using all armors, or medium armors, or a single type of armor, like brigandine. Obviously, the
          broader
          the area of knowledge the more applications but the most expensive it’s going to be to increase your bonus
          with
          them.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='EverytypewilUsRezelGcW' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'EverytypewilUsRezelGcW'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Every type will also have areas you can specialize in. These are the same across the Tiers of that type of
          Advanced Training, but you train in specific Tiers. So, Armor Advanced Training has Defense, Recovery
          Modifier,
          Fatigue, and Initiative as its areas. Each purchase in that area gives them a Rank in one of the Tiers, which
          is
          a bonus that’s applied when applicable. This bonus can't bring a negative bonus above 0, however.</p>

          that
          Tier or you have two areas in that Tier at the current highest Rank. This is true all the way down so your

        <p>For example, let’s say that you want to increase your training in Scale Armor, which, as we all know, has the
          stats of Def 0, Init 3, Recovery 1, and Fatigue of Bloodied. If you want to get a Rank 5 in Fatigue, you would
          have to buy up to a Rank 4 in a different category, Rank 3 in another, and Rank 2 in a final thing.</p>

        <p>It often pays to specialize. After all, many dissertations cover extremely minute subjects with incredible

          and drawing on that well of knowledge can be a huge benefit.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SkillSpecialimNswHyGqRo'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Skill Specializations represent an area of knowledge within an Advanced Skill that your character spends
          extra
          time versing themselves in. As such, they gain a bonus.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SkillspecialiwYXmQPvquB'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Skill specializations come in layers, modifiers that narrow down the field. Each layer gives a +1 to your
          effective Rank when it comes into play.</p>

        <p>For example, a monster hunter studying predators, would gain a+1 Rank, while another that studies flying
          predators would gain a +2 Rank bonus to their checks, and a monster hunter that studies the flying predators
          of
          the Uchka Mountains would gain a bonus of +3 to their Rank.</p>

        <p>There may come a time when a specialization only kind of applies. In this case, it may be kind of helpful, as
          the
          max bonus that can be gained from it is +1.</p>

        <p>That sort of super-focused study takes a lot of time and effort, and man only has so much time and energy to
          give. The total number of specializations per Advanced Skill that a character can have is equal to half his
          Intelligence score.</p>

        <p>A character can gain a specialization like any other skill; having his character go out of the way to learn
          more
          about his craft. The price is the base cost of the Advanced Skill times the number of layers in the
          specialization plus one.</p>

        <p>A character can go back and increase the number of layers in his Skill Specialization after his initial
          purchase
          of it, but it costs additional amount of CrPs equal to twice the base cost of the Advanced Skill.</p>

          would be 4 Climbing Checks in this order: +d4!, +d10! (d8! for base but because it’s 40 ft, it gets bumped up

        <p>You may also increase the Difficulty modifier by half again as much - if you succeed, you take 2 days off per

          Artistry (wood cutting) to create the heraldry on it, but someone trying to forge an official declaration from
          scratch does need to have the Literacy Skill in that language plus Artistry (wood cutting).</p>

        <p>With this Skill Suite, someone can identify a spell, point out needed regents and processes for ritual
          shapings,
          detect if something is touched by the Weird and what its properties are, or even detect if a spell has been
          cast
          in an area, and have a chance of finding out what it was.</p>

        <p>Unlike other Advanced Skilled, the Weirdcraft Advanced Skills pretty much work the same and so don't need

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThefirstbonujVlOALXuuq'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>The first bonus that having an Advanced Weirdcraft Skill gives you is that it gives you further insight into
          a
          particular Weird Tradition, allowing you to detect it better. For more information on what each Tradition
          specializes in, head over to <a [routerLink]='["/rules-reference/6"]'>Chapter 6:: The Weird</a>.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'TheotherthinlJvNEysbrj'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>The other thing it does is allow you to shape cantrip versions of spells from that Tradition, regardless of
          Archetype. The ability to shape is inherit in all living things though it takes decades of practice, a strong
          family bloodline, and/or a natural gift to do what Weird-Adept Archetypes do, a form of practical "folkweird"
          is
          often passed down as part of the tools of the trade.</p>

        <p>This doesn't, and will never, allow someone to shape the full version of a spell but it can give them a boost
          or
          an edge. The specific details should be left up to the GM and player, but they should always be appropriate to
          the Tradition and never be more powerful than a spell that does the same thing. Most commonly this will mean
          it
          will get used as a Helper Skill.</p>

        <p>Shaping a cantrip is still shaping and is stressful and so that anytime any of these Skills are used to
          shape,
          the shaper gets 2d4! Stress.</p>
