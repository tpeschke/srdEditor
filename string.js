  <p>Experts are those that focus on real-world non-combat skills, as opposed to relying
    on the Divines, magic, or
    their sword arm as a source of strength. They tend to rely on Intellect and
    Wisdom, primarily, though there are
    Experts that focus on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution for more physical
    skills.</p>

  <p><strong>FALL FORWARD </strong>Some people seem to stubble into
    where they need to be,
    even when they completely fail. When the Opportunist fails a Check, takes
    damage, or loses a round, he gains a
    roll of his Honor Dice. This is limited to 1 initially (so failing a second roll
    won't do him any good at level 1), but for every 3 levels the Opportunist has
    obtained,
    he increases the max number of Honor Dice this ability gives him by 1.</p>

  <p><strong>NATURAL ADVANTAGE </strong>An Opportunist lives on his
    wits and his ability to use every advantage. At the start of every Combat,
    Confrontation, or Skill Challenge, he may change one thing about the field for
    every
    5 Stress he takes. These changes must be consistent with an overarching setting
    (he can’t choose to have the inn change to a ship or flood right at that moment
    but he can choose to have a convenient chair or barrel right behind one of his
    enemies or reposition himself next to the fighter).</p>

  <p><strong>UNDER PRESSURE </strong>When times get tough, the tough

  <p><strong>BUYING TIME </strong>The sands of the hourglass trickle
    onward but sometimes you can slow it down for a moment or two. During a Skill
    Challenge on a failed Check, for each point of Honor you spend to modify the
    roll, increase your roll by 2 instead.
    This can’t, however, turn the failure into a success so if you intend to change
    failure into success, you don't gain this benefit.</p>

    Friendly, though not from Hostile to Neutral in one Confrontation.
    This is only temporary, however, ending a few hours after first contact.</p>

  <p><strong>ADVANCED TACTICS </strong>A Barbarian is a skirmisher
    and doesn’t rely on formalized training methods like other fighters. As such,
    their
    greatest strength is the utilization of Tactics. At 1st level and at every 2nd
    level after that, a
    Barbarian can increase the bonus or
    lower the penalty for a Tactic by 1, though they can never make a penalty a
    bonus nor go beyond double a bonus’s
    original amount. So, the max you can get the Faint to is +10 to Attack and +0 to
    your Defense.</p>

  <p><strong>SCARIFICATION </strong>For every battle and victim, the

    as armor as his skin hardens. The Berserker gains 1 DR at first level and for
    every 4
    levels obtained. Against a weapon,
    use whichever is highest (whether it’s the /D or static DR). This ability
    does stack with armor but the scars chaff and rub, so double any penalties

  <p><strong>BATTLE FRENZY </strong>These warriors are able to drive
    themselves into a crazed
    frenzy, giving them almost supernatural abilities. While in a Battle Frenzy, the

    Pain Tolerant and Scarification and makes them temporarily immune to penalties

    from Wounds as per normal.</p>

  <p>There are drawbacks to the Frenzy. The first is that the Berserker can take no
    defensive actions. This includes any defensive Tactics
    but also prevents him from actively crouching behind his shield for cover and,
    when doing aggressive actions, they are less careful,
    doubling their penalties from the same. Additionally, there is a price to
    pay for driving your body for so long; when you drop out of the Frenzy, you take
    enough damage, on one Wound, to drop you another
    Wound Category. You also gain no benefits from Taking a Breather after
    doing so until you drop another Wound Category (so
    you can't just heal it back up, sorry).

    becomes, however, the easier it is to get into the right frame of mind, so

  <p><strong>CLOSED OPENINGS</strong> Flanking is the art of

  <p><strong>MUTIEREN</strong> A Cateran knows to move their blade to
    get into places
    their opponents wouldn't expect. If facing an enemy whose weapon has a base
    Parry or who is carrying a shield,
    the Cateran receives a +1 to Attack +1 for every 2 levels they've obtained. This

  <p><strong>BUM RUSH</strong> A Cateran can also use his allies to
    more effectively flank their
    opponents. When flanking from the side, you and your allies lower your target’s
    defense die by 1,
    including
    the dice of those using shields (though they still get a chance to Parry). This
    doesn’t, however, give you any benefit for attacking from directly behind.</p>

  <p><strong>KNOW YOUR ENEMY</strong> A Man-at-Arms is good at

    either
    Threatening someone or someone is Threatening her, she gains a cumulative bonus
    to Attack,

    This bonus, and what she can choose to apply it to is based on her Advanced

  <p> Tier 3 gives her a +1, Tier 2 gives her a +2, and Tier 1 gives her a +3.
    She can only apply this bonus
    to a metric she has an Advanced Training Bonus in. So, for example, if she is
    fighting someone with a slashing sword
    and she has a +1 to Attack and Defense with all Slashing weapons (Tier 2), that
    means, for every 20 seconds she is fighting
    that person, she can add an additional +2 to her Attack or Defense.

    So, if the Man-At-Arms is Threatening two foes for 20 seconds, she can apply her
    bonus to attacking one, while
    the other bonus goes to defending against another. If one she is defending
    against leaves, she has to continue applying her bonus

  <p>When an Ashcaller prays to a particular spirit, they enter into a Confrontation with
    them with a number of rounds equal to the amount of Favor spent, trying to
    convince them to help. At the end of the Confrontation, the Miracle is invoked
    and
    the Ashcaller rolls his Honor Dice
    with a bonus (or penalty) equal the difference in points. This Confrontation
    takes
    1 second per round.</p>

  <p><strong>LINKED to the BONES of YMIR </strong>Harnessing the

    the world in a more real way. He gains Favor equal to his Honor Category + 1/2

  <p><strong>MARKS of the EARTH </strong>Through ceremony and ritual,
    the Symbolist is able to invoke Miracles that are normally reserved only for the

    During the ceremony, he selects a certain number of his Favor and “locks” into

  <p>Doing so essentially invokes a Miracle on that person, however, unlike a normal
    Miracle, it persists for as long as the person marked wishes it and there is a
    distinct chance of failure: the Symbolist must roll over 10 on their Honor Dice.
    He gains an additional roll of the Honor Dice for every Favor he locks in.</p>

  <p>Unlike normal, the Miracle doesn’t give the full Honor Dice as a bonus whenever the

  <p>Like normal Miracles, however, this can modify things you normally couldn’t, like
    Movement speed or Knock-Back, or what-have-you. The GM may also increase this
    bonus if he feels it is appropriate (getting a +1 to your equipment breaking

  <p><strong>MIRRORING</strong> By agreeing with your enemy, you can
    sometimes lull them into a false sense of security, causing them to lower their
    guard. A Foil can take 10 Stress and make a guess at a Characteristic his
    opponent has. If he’s correct, that Characteristic loses 1 dice for every 2
    levels he’s obtained, down to 1 dice. He also automatically receives points
    equal to the dice removed.</p>

  <p><strong>GASLIGHTING</strong> A Foil’s particularly devious when

    thus
    shaking his opponent's confidence in their arguments. If a Foil starts the

    loses, they can take 10 Stress. If they do, they gain half the points they would
    have gotten if they had succeeded.
    They reduce the Stress inflicted by 1 for every 4 levels they've obtained, down

  <p><strong>SHIFT BLAME</strong> There’s strength in numbers,
    especially when those numbers are used as a shield. When his side makes a
    successful Appeal, the Foil can sacrifice 1 Honor to choose whose dice gets
    added as points instead of going with the lowest. That person, however, is
    thrown headfirst into a stressful situation, suddenly becoming the center of
    attention, giving them 3 Stress for every point of difference between what
    they’re added and what would have been added. This penalty is lowered by 1
    Stress for every 10 levels the Foil has obtained.</p>

  <p><strong>UNIMPRESSED </strong>A Knave knows that silly titles are

  <p><strong>PLAYING DIRTY </strong>While others hoard their precious
    Honor for the sake of not having people talk bad about them, the Knave doesn’t
    care and so she can use her as a weapon. A Knave can lose 3 Honor to increase
    one of her Characteristic dice by 1 and reroll all non-exploded dice she’s using
    in
    her Appeal that round. She can also increase 1 extra dice by 1 size for every 2
    levels she’s obtained.</p>

    the Knave and her allies). This follows the normal rules if a Characteristic
    would drop below a d4!, however, the Knave’s never drop below 1d4!.</p>

  <p><strong>LUCKY </strong> The Rascal is naturally blessed with the
    ability to get out of trouble and use that adrenaline that comes as death comes
    near to dodge the grim reaper and keep running. After the results are given,
    the Rascal can take 2 Stress to modify his results by 1. These may be done with
    the
    following conditions:</p>

    <p>They can never be used to make you a better fighter. Stress gained this way

    type, however, a lot is left up to chance. The Mage rolls randomly for the
    Shape, Origin, and Range of the spell and d3! SP that they can spend on the
    Effect (which you select after learning what the Shape, Origin, and Range is).

  <p>When considering Drain, the Mage only has to worry about the Effect’s Base Drain and

  <p class="italic">So, for example, a level 3 Mage finishes channeling and casts
    Flashbang. He rolls
    randomly and gets Circle, Double, and Aura, He rolls d8 and gets a 5 the Effect.
    He rolls his free dice and gets a 3. Since he’s shaping Flashbang, he doesn’t
    want it to be an Aura (since he’ll be caught in it to), so he spends 2 of his
    free points to move it to “Near”, and then uses the final point to give him 6 SP
    so he can actually cast it.</p>

  <p>It is recommended that even though you don’t technically get those points until after
    that 7 second duration, that you roll everything ahead of time and figure out
    what you’re going to cast ahead of time. The GM is not obliged to stop the count
    for you if you haven’t been spending those 7 seconds wisely.</p>

    doesn’t remove those SP but the Mage does lose 1 SP every 6 seconds.</p>

  <p>An ethereal being in a physical world, the Sourcerer draws his magic from an internal
    well within them. As such, they don’t cast spells so much as manifest them into
    existence. Unlike most other weird-adepts, the Sourcerer doesn’t rely on luck or
    Astral Winds, but instead generates power from within. This is a slower process
    making Sourcerers less helpful in the moment but more powerful given a bit of
    time.</p>

  <p><strong>WILD MAGIC SHAPING</strong> The Wizard is able to
    channel the power of the stars, harnessing it and creating magical energy. While

  <p>After 10 seconds, the Wizard gains d10! Spell Points (SP), which is a single pool
    that
    can be spent to shape the Weird on the fly out of any Rudiments he knows. The
    spell’s Drain is then subtracted from the Wizard’s Spell Point pool when he

      For weapons and other items, they may also cast spells with a Touch
      Origin on a successful hit, storing one spell indefinitely until it’s
