|lThere’s a lot to being a good player but the core of it is wrapped up in having a good character. To have a good character, you must have a character that...|pYou Want to Play|pThe GM Gets Excited About|pThe Other Players Can Interact With|1You Want to Play|lIf you’re not excited, bellying up to the table every session is going to be a chore and you’ll disengage from whatever is going on in the campaign. Most people are good at this already but it’s important to not lose sight of this qualification when you’re juggling the others. |pGoing forward, it is on you to be proactive about finding things that inspire you but that also jive with everyone else at the table. But this is an ongoing process because the mistake that many players make is that they build a character they think they want to play but then end up not enjoying.|lAnd this isn’t their fault; it could be the result of the setting, campaign, the system, or all three. It can also come from you getting excited about a new character or just getting bored of the same old same old. You can lose the ‘why’ of what excites you about the character. This is especially true of long campaigns.|pYou can, of course, ask your GM if you can remake your character or bring in a new one. If you have a stable of henchmen, this is easy (and one of the reasons that Bonfire implemented the system) but, if you’ve been neglecting that part of character advancement, ask your GM if you could run an allied NPC|pBut this doesn’t have to be permanent; you can bring in the new character as a ‘guest’ character that you run for an adventure or a few sessions before flipping back to your old character. You can even tie them to locations - when in the city of Hoffinlau, you pay the rogue, Irna, while your main character visits with their parents. When you hit the road, Irna stays behind.|pGMs don’t want you to burn out on your character and will want to keep you, the player involved, so talk to them about how such an arrangement might work and how to weave the guest character in naturally.|1That the GM Gets Excited About|lWhat separates a solid character from a great character is the GM being excited about them. Good GMs are fans of your character but they are human. Most importantly, the GM is running a game because they’re excited about the world, the adventure, the campaign and you don’t want to squash that excitement.|pIf you create a character that the GM isn’t excited about, it’s going to cause a few problems. The first, for you, is that the GM won’t get involved in your character’s story which will mean that they’ll see less of the spotlight and you’ll lose out on things like story beats and treasure designed for your character.|lBeyond that, if your GM isn’t onboard with your character, you could end up squashing their excitement for the adventure or campaign, which will lead them to burn out and wrapping up the game quickly, which means that it doesn’t matter how excited you are to play your character; you won’t get to play them.|pSo, how do you get GM buy-in for your character? How do you get the GM excited about your character?|pThe first is that you need to understand the setting and tone of the campaign and then build a character concept to support it. You can’t expect the GM to even like your character if you don’t pay attention to the setting they build or the adventure they’ve made, which is what the GM is excited about.|lInclude your GM in character creation; ask for input and ideas. See which ideas in the game they’re running that they’re excited for and then see where it overlaps with what you’re excited for.|lIt’s natural that, when one is given a boundary, to want to push against it or be an exception because it’s a way of making us stick out and feel special. Resist that urge; if your GM says that the campaign is only orcs, be an orc. There are other, limitless, ways to be special within restrictions. If your GM has buy-in with your character, they’ll be looking for ways to make them special.|pOn a more practical side, don’t make a character who is good at everything. Try to have at least one weakness for each type of challenge; combat, social, and skill. Your GM wants to challenge you because that can make for a compelling character. If the GM is struggling to challenge you, they will get burnt out; they’re already doing a ton of work so try not to make their job harder.|lHaving weaknesses also allows other characters to shine. Don’t seek to eliminate them unless you create new weaknesses that other players can cover and the GM can use to challenge your character.|pGMs don’t want to squash your enthusiasm for the game because that excitement is important so many will pretend to be excited about your character concept or just give their approval rather than try and tease out a compromise. Finding middle ground is hard and your GM already has a lot on their plate but they might also have been hurt by previous players who were needlessly belligerent and selfish so be patient with them and look for these warning signs:|pDid the GM hesitate when you gave them the concept?|pDid they offer suggestions or did they just silently listen and approve the concept?|pDid/Does the GM add things just for the character?|lMoments of challenge, triumph; treasure or NPC interaction|lThis is an ongoing process so just keep an eye out for these warning signs as the adventure goes on. |pI loved my first character to death but it wasn’t until years later when I was talking about old stories and adventures with the GM, “Mark”, that ran the character, that I discovered something. I mentioned that I loved that character but that Mark seemed to have disengaged from them at some point. |pMark got visibly mad; He explained that he loved that character too but because I, in my excitement to play the character, ran off and started running them through solo adventures so, when they would come back to the table, the character was changed.|pIt clicked with me; Mark had done a lot for that character, including running a campaign for them that I pitched to him. Many of the stories that I loved to tell about my character were a direct result of Mark being invested.|pI was too young and too stupid to realize and cherish it for the gift it was. Because of my shortsightedness, not only was I no longer able to play the character but I had also contributed to Mark not wanting to run me again and, to this day, he’s one of the best GMs I’ve ever run under.|lLearn from my mistakes and don’t repeat them.|1That the Other Players Can Interact With|pAdmittedly, this is the least important section but it’s still important. It can also be the easiest because the bar is low; the other players don’t have to be excited about your character - they don’t even have to know your character in-depth - they just have to know how to interact with your character.|pThis can basically be summed up with “do the other players know what your character brings to the table?” Other players need to know what your character’s utility to them is and their characters. When they know that, they can bring you in to help them and get your character involved, allowing you to play more.|lIf they don’t, at best, you’ll find your character excluded from the action; when they make plans, they won’t include your character. When they talk about things, you might find you, as a player, not included. If you’re lucky, they’ll talk to you about this but, often, they won’t and you’ll find yourself on the outside looking in. Eventually, you’ll not be invited back.|pSo, how do we create utility for your character and how do we communicate it to the other players?|pStart by including other players in character creation. This doesn’t mean that they need to sit down with you and go over every choice but, at periodic points, check in with the other players and their characters. Find what is missing in the party. This can be from a skill perspective (“we don’t have a fighter”) but it can also be from an archetype perspective (“our heist gang needs a Q-type character to help with gear”).|lCreate character’s that compliment the rest of the party. |pAs with GMs, look for warning signs that you might need to adapt or replace your character:|pOther players can’t describe when they would ask your character to help|pOther player characters can do what your character does but better|pYou can do what another character does but better|lOther players don’t talk to your character or initiate any kind of interaction|1Final Thoughts|lCreating a good character is the start of being a good player but here are some final thoughts that are worth mentioning.|lAt the table, everyone else’s fun is your first priority. If they’re not having fun, you’re creating friction that will lead to burn out.|lIf, over a period of time, you come to discover that it is close to impossible to hit all 3 points or if you find that, while you’re looking out for everyone else at the table, they’re not looking out for you, you might be in the wrong group. That’s okay - it takes all kinds of people to make a world and not every table should be the same - but it does mean that it’s time to move on. Some friends are good as friends but not as players or GMs.|lLike identity, your character is a dialogue between you, the GM, and the other players. This requires give and take, as well as listening. Generally, you’ll find that, if you’re willing to listen to others first, they will listen to you in turn. It also requires overlap in interest and chemistry between the people talking for things to really click and come alive.|pDuring play, while trying to find solutions, don’t reach. At best, it’s annoying; at worst, it’s pathetic. Default to accepting what the GM says and move on. If any argument takes more than a minute, drop it and move on. Dragging out the argument is only going to burn out the GM and make them resentful of you. Even if you’re right, you’re not doing yourself, the GM, or the other players a favor|lIf it is not how it works in the real world, assume that it is an exception of the GM’s world, in the same way magic isn’t real but it’s a thing in your GM’s world.|pThe journey to being a good player is a long one that does take effort but it will leave you with heroic stories you’ll remember for the rest of your life and, probably more importantly, turn the strangers around the table into lifelong friends and companions so it is worth taking.
