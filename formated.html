    <p>The GM will also adjust your Reputation and complete your Reputation sentences as she deems appropriate. She gets
        to add 1 point at this point but she can also move as many existing points around as she wants. She may also
        change the ending to any Reputation sentences she wants.</p>

    <p>She may also ‘free’ them up to distribute later: so if your character moves far away where people haven’t heard
        of them, you could lose your Reputation, which might be good or bad.</p>

    <p>Note to GMs: while you can complete the sentences at any time, giving the player a heads up as to where their
        Reputation is headed, it isn’t advised that you start putting points into the other two Reputations until the
        character reaches 5th level.</p>

    <p>If you’ve reached 10th level, your GM should also roll to see if you’ve attracted a follower.</p>
