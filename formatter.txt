They get no Stress when adding Devotions or Convictions to Recruit or Rally Check.|*Invictus |pThe Armiger not only gets others to do their duty but to go above and beyond.

Whenever he wins a Confrontation Check that involves at least 1 of his Devotions, He can subtract that Devotion’s Rank from the Stress he would normally get from it.|pAllies taking Stress as a result of participating in the Champion’s Check also have their Stress reduced by his Devotion’s Rank.|*Fanatical Honor |pThe Champion’s oath and zeal to upholding it allows them to rise above others.

When someone defends against a Knave’s argument with an Appeal or Line of Reasoning, they gain twice the Stress.|bGlory Hole |pThose that try and use their status against the Knave find little but apathy. When in a Confrontation with the Knave, enemies can’t spend Honor or Honor Dice on any Checks.|bWrestling With a Pig |pWhen you wrestle with a pig, you both get muddy but the pig loves it. You can sacrifice Honor to bring down an opponent’s Check on a 1-to-1 basis, however, if you bring their total below 0, they also gain a d4! Stress on top of any other Stress they would normally get.|bIn Weakness, Strength |pWhile others see their Flaws as something that holds them back, Knaves consider them with pride since they’re what make them unique.
