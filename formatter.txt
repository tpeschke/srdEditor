|lThis chapter outlines the baseline mechanics that Bonfire uses for its systems.|1When to Make Checks|lIf you’re an old hand at RPGs, this might seem like a silly section, but it is something to think about and it something that new GMs should learn.|lWhen do you actually roll dice? And what do those dice do? Let’s take this one question at a time.|2When to Roll Dice|pThink about an RPG session like a conversation: there’s a back and forth between GM and players and a back and forth between players and other players.|lBut, unlike a normal conversation, there’s a point where dice are rolled, and the results read.|lVery simply, it looks like the flowchart below.|l99% of all RPG sessions will follow this flow, and those that don’t, only vary in minor ways, which we’ll talk about.|lThis is an extremely in-depth subject, but this section is primarily for new GMs so I’m only going to cover the basics.|3Meaningful Failure|pI wanted to take a small aside to talk about meaningful failure because, if there isn’t a chance of it it is the GM’s prerogative to simply wave the check, saying that the players succeed.|pThis is just a matter of streamlining the session: if failure doesn’t affect anything, there’s no point spending time on it.|pThis is usually meant in a mechanic sense (getting wounded) but it can also be in a story sense (it has no effect on the events going forward).|3Session Critical|pThis is a common mistake for new GMs.|lIf you need a check to result in a certain outcome you should rewrite the session you had planned.|pAn example I see all the time is GMs putting the adventure hook behind a check. A man has a job for the players but will only give it to them if they can demonstrate that they have the skills.|lBut they fail all the rolls. The GM stops a second and then gives them the hook anyway. |pIf that’s the way the session is written; go back to the drawing board because it makes everything seem faked and contrived.|lFor me, personally, it also inflicts doubt in my actual agency as a player. Did I really beat the villain because of what I did or did the GM just fudge the outcome because that’s what they wanted?|2What Do Those Dice Mean?|lSomething a lot of GMs don’t consider is the idea of structures within a game system.|lThere’s the resolution mechanic (how do I determine success or failure) but what that resolution mechanic means is based in the context of what is going on.|lFor instance, rolling an attack roll in a combat means you’re trying to physically hit someone or something with your weapon with the intent to kill or subdue while rolling to attack in an interrogation scene is more about striking to scare rather than wound.|lThat context is often nested in a structure. For instance, the combat is nested in the “Combat” structure which determines how often that attack can be made while the interrogation scene doesn’t work when you run it like a combat.|lBut a lot of games don’t give you structures to run different types of scenes: they don’t give you the structure that helps you (and your players) play that interrogation scene out.|pBonfire isn’t going to make that mistake and so the next 3 chapters are going to be 3 different structures that you can use for 3 very different types of scenes.|lAs you get familiar with them, you should play around with them; tweak them, add to them, remove parts from them, and combine them, but only do so once you’ve mastered them.|lDoing so will open up and depth and breathe to roleplaying that will astound you and will give your players the tools to play some truly unique characters.|1Making Checks|lWhen you need to determine the outcome of a question or action, you’re going to make a Check.|lYou’ll do this by rolling a die, determined by the framework and then adding any relevant Check Modifiers. A lot of times, these modifiers will be determined by the Skill or Training you’re using.|lThe opposition will roll a similar die and add any relevant modifiers on their side.|lThe side with the high total wins the Check. What that means is dependent on the framework.|2Exploding Dice|lYou’ll notice an exclamation mark (!) behind a lot of dice notations. This marks the dice as exploding, which means that should the maximum of that dice is rolled, you get to roll it again, this time with a - 1, and add what you rolled to the total.|lThis continues for as long as you roll the maximum dice, however, the - 1 always stays a -1 one.|lSo, if you roll a 3d8! for damage, you get a 5, 8, 8. Since you rolled the maximum value on two of your dice, you roll those dice again, and roll an 8, and 5, giving you a subtotal of 32 ( 5 + 8 + 8 + 8 - 1 + 5 - 1 ) but since you rolled another 8, you get to roll that dice again, and you get a 1, netting you a 0 ( 1 - 1 ).|lThere are two things you should be aware of: 1d100! explode to a 1d20!, while 1d20! explode to a d6!.|lThe second thing is that explosion dice don’t add additional dice to the number. So, in the example above, all that damage is only counted as having been done with 3 dice (instead of the 5 that were actually rolled).|1Stress|pWorking under pressure can get to you. When your crew mates are relying on you to pull out a win, it can mess with your head. Your character can become stressed under these circumstances and stress can later manifest in odd behaviors.|lCharacters can gain Stress in a lot of ways and those are discussed in their various sections - taking damage, making Skill Checks, etc. - the only one we’ll go over here is from acting against your character’s Characteristics, especially when not playing them would be a huge benefit.|2Stress Penalties|lStress affects almost everything you do, making your life harder and your character becomes emotionally pent up.|lEvery 10 points of Stress gives you a penalty of 1 to Defense and Skill Checks.|2Healing Stress|pStress heals slowly over time: the more stress you have, the longer it takes to heal.|pThis is charted using Relaxation.|pWhen a character’s Relaxation reaches their current stress, it resets to 0 and they lower their stress by 1, making high stress exponentially more difficult to heal.|lBut there are a lot of ways to gain Relaxation.|3Taking Time Off|pA person is considered to spend 8 hours sleeping, with the rest of the day (16 hours), doing things.|lHowever, for each hour your character takes to rest (read a good book, indulge in a hobby, take a bath), they get 1 Relaxation.|lAdditionally, by spending silver, you can increase that amount on a 10-silver-to-1-Relaxation basis.|lSo, going out to dinner for 2 hours would normally give you 2 Relaxation, but going to a fancy dinner and spending 50 Credits on it, gives you 7 instead.|3Flaws|pAnother option you have is to give yourself penalties due to your Flaws.|lHaving a Flaw increases the opponent’s Check by the Flaw’s Severity but heals you an amount of Stress equal to the roll of that die.|3Creature Comforts|pFinally, you can indulge in creature comforts.|lThis is similar to spending silver while taking time off, but these represent permanent purchases, like getting a really nice mattress for your bunk.|lIn this case, whenever a Trait would apply, you get an extra point of Relaxation.|lSo, if you’re hiking but you have extra-padded, tailored boots, you would get 3 Relaxation.|2Mental Breakdowns|lA character whose stress has gone beyond their Stress Threshold is suffering from a mental breakdown.|lThey seek to remove themselves from the stressful situation as quickly as possible and advance or gain a Flaw.|lThis is specific to the situation, but the character has lost all rationality and so will take the more direct route, even if it exposes them.|pFor example, a character that’s having a mental breakdown in the middle of the fight drops their weapon, stands up, turns, and runs for the nearest exit at full speed: exposing themselves to the enemy.|lOr they might simply drop their weapon and plead for mercy – refusing to defend themselves.|1Vitality|pVitality represents how close you are to passing out and dying. It is both your health and stamina. As you take damage, you will get closer to death and gain more penalties based on your Fatigue.|2Physical States|lVitality is divided into 4 categories which are, in order, HURT (H), BLOODIED (B), WOUNDED (W), CRITICAL (C). Each of these make up a fourth of your Vitality.|lThese are a way to easily communicate a fighter’s health (both player-to-player and GM-to-player) but crossing certain categories have additional penalties.|2Fatigue|pAs stated, the more damage you take, the harder the fight becomes. When this happens is noted by your Fatigue|lFatigue is matched to a wound category: hitting that wound category means that you start rolling your all Checks on 1 lower die.|3Change Equipment While Wounded|pSince Fatigue is partly determined by the shield you're using, a quick way to up your Fatigue is to simply drop you shield.|lNow, the flip side of this is that if you become MORE encumbered while wounded, you could get|2Beyond Critical|lA character whose total damage is beyond Critical is dead: roll up a new character.|pThe only exception is if your character is moving towards their goal.|pIn this case, they can continue to keep fighting until the end of the combat or until they reach double what they would need to reach Critical again.|lHowever, this is a short lease: they’re still dead and no healing or medicine can bring them back.|2Healing Damage|lWhenever a character takes damage, they record another wound. |lAfter a number of days equal to a wound’s current damage, you remove 1 damage from that wound.|lThis means that a 3-damage wound would take 3 days to become a 2-damage wound, which would take 2 days to become a 1-damage wound, and so on.|lThe upside is that all wounds heal simultaneously: if you have 10 3-damage wounds, it will only take you 6 days to completely heal.|lThere are other ways to speed up healing as well:|3First Aid|pBy administering first aid within the first 10 minutes of a wound being inflicted, you lower the damage by 1.|lYou can only do this once per wound, however.|3Medicine|pBy administering the proper medication, it can greatly speed up healing, removing 1 day from each wound for each point of damage, although there’s a minimum of 1 day.|lSo, for that 3-damage wound, it would only take 2 days to get to 2 damage, and 1 day to get to 1 damage.|3Resting & Nursing|lYou can also take time off and not put a lot of stress and pressure on yourself: allowing your body to focus on healing.|lIn this case, if you have no Stress, every point of Relaxation gained that day is taken off the days to heal instead, however, you can only heal 1 damage a day and it only applies to 1 wound.|1Fallen Comrades|pWatching your friends die around you or abandon you is extremely Stressful, even if you’re winning. |lEach time a side loses a quarter of their original number (either through dying, going unconscious, or running away), those remaining gain d10! Stress.|1Taking a Breather|pPausing and resting for 1 heals you half the damage and Stress (rounded down) that you've take since the last time you've Taken a Breather.|lIf the rest is broken for any reason, you lose all benefit from it.|1Honor|lHonor is a measure how not only how a person measures their own integrity but also how other people see them. Honor isn’t about doing the commonsense thing; it’s about doing the heroic thing. People who run from a fight, even when outnumbered, lose Honor. People who let others talk bad about them and don’t get even lose Honor.|lThe question of Honor isn’t a question of good and evil; many evil men have been honorable. It’s more about living up to the ideals of your culture and being true to your inner self.|2Categories & Bonuses|pHonor has its benefits. Confidence allows you to push yourself a little bit more than you otherwise would. During the game, you can spend your Honor points to influence anything, rolls or static metrics, whenever you want on a 1 to 1 basis. |pDoing so lowers your Honor but might save your character’s life. So, if you roll a 13 and your opponent rolls a 14, you could spend 3 Honor to beat their total. Likewise, if an enemy deals 8 damage to you and you have 6 Honor, you could spend all of it and only take 2 damage.|lAdditionally, each category has an Honor Dice, which can be rolled to add or subtract like Honor.|lHonor cannot go above 25 or below 0. The size of the Honor Die is also determined at the beginning of session and doesn’t change during play even if the category does.|3Dishonor|p0 - 5 Honor, No Honor Die|lThe lowest category, this person is unsure that they have what it takes to be a hero and so every decision is laced with hesitation and uncertainty.|3Low Honor|p6 - 10 Honor, d4!|lThis character hasn’t really proved anything, one way or another. Others and herself are waiting for her to make her mark on the world.|3Average Honor|p11 - 15 Honor, d6!|lHaving reached this category, the character has shown that they have potential and some follow through.|3High Honor|p16 - 20 Honor, d8!|lShe has now separated herself from the common rabble and can stand a head above the crowd.|3Great Honor|p21 - 25 Honor, d10!|lThis rare sliver represents those who can perfectly balance being ahead of others but not so much so that they invoke the ire of those below them as well as being confident while not being cocky. |5Honor Through Accountability|pIn the heat of the moment, it’s hard to keep track of all the bonuses and penalties that apply to situations, especially the penalties and especially Stress penalties, which change during the fight.|pBecause of this, it isn’t required that you apply Stress penalties. However, if you do, you gain 1 Honor, and the other side also applies their Stress penalty without that extra Honor.|lIf the GM reminds you that you need to apply your Stress, you don’t get anything but the penalty.|1Favor|lFavor is a measure of your standing with a given god. It’s not an absolute measure, however, but more a measure of the chance that a Divine will answer your prayer. How far your Favor goes ranges widely based on how devoted you are to a god and how Honor you are.|2Invoking Miracles|lNow that you’ve got a nice stash of Favor, you probably want to spend it. That’s pretty simple: pray out loud for the Miracle in question. Silent prayers don’t work because no Divine is going to answer a prayer, they’re not going to get credit for.|lFor every Favor you spend, you get another use of your Honor Dice but comes with a few differences: the first, and most major, is that you can spend it on ANYTHING - you want to run faster or jump higher? You want to heal your wounds? You want to attack slightly faster? You can with Favor, however, the effects are only temporary, of course.|lThe second is that you can spend to change the world around you. Every Favor you spend can change a 5 ft square area with the following restriction: it can’t directly contradict things that have already been said.|lFor instance, you cannot wish to have an avalanche suddenly on the steppe or an inn to appear before the party that wasn’t there before, but you could wish for a flash flood or for an inn to be over the next rise, which was just out of view when you prayed.|2Restrictions|pMiracles are bound by Covenant: you can’t pray for something your Divine doesn’t have power over, so a Divine of the city can’t really help you in the mountains, for example.|lBut this is where being in a pantheon does help out: you can pray to another Divine in your pantheon for their blessing instead, but it requires twice as much Favor, and you don’t gain the benefit of your Cosmic Link.|pThe other restriction is that the Miracles need to be subtle: no angels coming down from the skies to keep you from falling to your death but perhaps there’s water or a passing hay cart that catches you just in time to soften your landing. There needs to be room for doubt.|3Sacred & Profane Spaces|pHoly places are those areas that are closer to the God’s Realm, where the Middle Realm is weaker. There the faithful can almost feel the Divines walking around.|lIn a sacred space dedicated to a certain Divine, the Honor Dice you get becomes 1 size larger. It also fills the devoted with a sense of purpose, temporarily increasing their Devotion by 1 for Confrontations and, if defending the space, their Devotion applies to Morale, of course.|pThere are also those areas that are abhorrent to the gods. Desecrated altars, dwarven holds, and other spaces the Divine presence is absent.|lThese Profane spaces net Honor Dice 1 size smaller, down to a d2 for each Favor spent to the Divine space is Profane to. The unanointed are completely unable to invoke Miracles.|
