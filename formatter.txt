|hReputation|lReputation, in a nutshell, is what your character is known for and how other people see them. So, if you want to convince someone that you’ll keep your word, having a Reputation for doing so will help you out.|pReputation takes the form of 3 incomplete sentences starting with “I’m known for...”. Each time you level up, your GM will finish or change out one or more of those sentences and assign points to them that represent their strength. She’ll choose how to finish them based on how your character has been acting or the results of their actions.|lThat’s right: just like in real life, you don’t really have control over your Reputation, though there is a way to influence it as you go.|pSo, for instance, Banwulf the fighter is a good hearted warrior who wants to protect the people of the town. After a raid, however, he finds himself in possession of a number of raider women and children.|pThe town’s leader, a highly influential person, tells him that he needs to put the captives to the sword since they’ll only grow up to continue the cycle of violence against the town but Banwulf demurs and, in the middle of the night, he releases them so they can escape.|lBanwulf, of course, receives Honor for his decision, but at level up, the GM completes one of his Reputation sentences. He becomes known for betraying his friends. This is because the town, who he previously protected, feels betrayed at his actions.|lIn a Conflict, Reputation counts as a form of Evidence, but instead of getting the standard 3 points, you instead get the Reputation’s strength in points. It can be combine with other Evidence or as a d8 if you’re using it to make an Appeal.|sATTRACTING NPCS|pWhile a character may use the Recruiting skill to find hirelings at any time, after a character reaches level 10, they start having people seek them out. At that point, and at every 2 levels (or 3 for those with a Weird-Adept Archetype) level above that, the GM rolls on the Follower Attraction table.|lThese come in three varieties:|bCAMP FOLLOWERS |pThese are those that wish to swim in the wake of the big fish, often profiting off the other followers of the party and are often washerwoman, prostitutes, or errand boys. They don’t ask anything of the party but are happy to be hired on for specialty jobs.|pThey’re also the least loyal, abandoning the party should the party start to lose Retainers and they’ll never put their lives on the line for the party.|bRETAINERS |pRetainers make up the paid help. They often seek out the party directly and have a basic skill. The idea is that the party will help them further their craft and connections for a bit of pay. They’ll make themselves as helpful as possible - such as repairing armor and weapons for the cost of room and board.|pRetainers won’t break contracts unless the captain of the party falls into Low Honor and will be more loyal than camp followers, however, they’ll only risk their lives if it’s in their contract to do so.|bSIDEKICKS |pSidekicks are something special. A Sidekick is a person who is completely loyal to a character. They would lay down their lives for a character. A character has a limited number of Sidekicks that he can call upon over the course of his whole life-time.|lSidekicks are childhood friends, people who deify the character, or other such unquestionably loyal followers.|pA Sidekicks is essentially a second Player Character that the player gets to run.|pAny new follower can be declared by the player to be a Sidekick, having sought out the party, he is recognized as an old friend or a new friend who swears undying loyalty to the character. Additionally, a follower can be elevated to the status of a Sidekick if he or the character saves the other’s life.|lEven before level 10, a character can search out his Sidekicks, however, they must be old friends from his past in this case.|pSidekicks start with an automatic Devotion 4 to the character and the character gains an equivalent Devotion in return.|lOnly severe abuse can break the bond between the hero and his Sidekick but should this happen, the Sidekick becomes an enemy of equivalent zeal.|sDAY 7: RECEIVE HONOR & ADJUST REPUTATION|bHONOR|lNow the other players will have a chance to adjust your HONOR by silently judging the character, rating him 1 to 10 in 3 categories: Flaws, Teamwork, Respect.|pThe GM will also adjust your Reputation and complete your Reputation sentences as she deems appropriate. She gets to add 1 point at this point but she can also move as many existing points around as she wants. She may also change the ending to any Reputation sentences she wants.|lShe may also ‘free’ them up to distribute later: so if your character moves far away where people haven’t heard of them, you could lose your Reputation, which might be good or bad.|lNote to GMs: while you can complete the sentences at any time, giving the player a heads up as to where their Reputation is headed, it isn’t advised that you start putting points into the other two Reputations until the character reaches 5th level.|lIf you’ve reached 10th level, your GM should also roll to see if you’ve attracted a follower.
